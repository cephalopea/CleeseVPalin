2,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus.
3,John Cleese,Hello again* and welcome to the show. Tonight we continue to look at some famous deaths. Tonight we start with the wonderful death of Genghis Khan* conqueror of India. Take it away Genghis.
4,John Cleese,Bad luck Genghis. Nice to have you on the show. And now here are the scores.
5,John Cleese,Thank you* Eddie. And now time for this week's request death.
6,John Cleese,For Mr and Mrs Violet Stebbings of 23 Wolverston Road* Hull* the death of Mr Bruce Foster of Guildford.
7,John Cleese,Oh blimey* how time flies. Sadly we are reaching the end of yet another programme and so it is finale time. We are proud to be bringing to you one of the evergreen bucket kickers. Yes* the wonderful death of the famous English Admiral Nelson.
8,Michael Palin,Il cucchiaio.
9,Michael Palin,Grazie signor ... grazie di tutta la sua gentilezza.
10,John Cleese,Mariolini.
11,John Cleese,Napoli* signor.
12,John Cleese,Si* si signor!
13,John Cleese,Ah* capisco* mile grazie signor...
14,Michael Palin,My friend say 'Why must he say...'
15,Michael Palin,My friend he say* 'Why must I say I am Italian from Napoli when he lives in Milan?'
16,Michael Palin,He say 'Milan is better than Napoli'.
17,Michael Palin,Yes* you know* we find that nine out of ten British housewives can't tell the difference between Whizzo butter and a dead crab.
18,John Cleese,Here. Here! You're on television* aren't you?
19,Michael Palin,Yes* yes.
20,John Cleese,He does the thing with one of those silly women who can't tell Whizzo butter from a dead crab.
21,Michael Palin,Good evening and welcome to another edition of 'It's the Arts'. And we kick off this evening with the cinema.
22,John Cleese,Good evening. One of the most prolific film directors of this age* or indeed of any age* is Sir Edward Ross* back in his native country for the first time for five years to open a season of his works at the National Film Theatre* and we are very fortunate to have him with us in this studio this evening.
23,John Cleese,Edward... you don't mind if I call you Edward?
24,John Cleese,Only it does worry some people - I don't know why...but they are a little sensitive so I take the precaution of asking on these occasions.
25,John Cleese,So Edward's all right. Splendid. Splendid. I'm sorry to have brought it up* only eh...
26,John Cleese,Well thank you very much for being so helpful...only it's more than my job's worth to...er...
27,John Cleese,Makes it rather difficult to establish a rapport ... to put the other person at his ease...
28,John Cleese,Yes* silly little point but it does seem to matter. Still - less said the better. Uh...Ted...when you first started in...you don't mind if I call you Ted?
29,John Cleese,Well it's shorter* isn't it.
30,John Cleese,Yes* and much less formal!
31,John Cleese,Splendid* splendid. Incidentally* do call me Tom* I don't want you playing around with any of this 'Thomas' nonsense! Ha ha ha ha! Now where were we? Ah yes. Eddie-baby* when you first started in the...
32,John Cleese,I'm sorry?
33,John Cleese,Did I call you 'Eddie-baby'?
34,John Cleese,I don't think I did call you Eddie-baby.
35,John Cleese,Did I call him Eddie-baby?
36,John Cleese,I didn't really call you Eddie-baby* did I* sweetie?
37,John Cleese,Can I call you sugar plum?
38,John Cleese,Pussy cat?
39,John Cleese,Angel-drawers?
40,John Cleese,Can I call you 'Frank'?
41,John Cleese,It's a nice name. Robin Day's got a hedgehog called Frank.
42,John Cleese,Frannie* little Frannie* Frannie Knickers...
43,John Cleese,Tell us about your latest film* Sir Edward.
44,John Cleese,Tell us about your latest film* if you'd be so very kind* Sir Edward.
45,John Cleese,Promise.
46,John Cleese,Please* Sir Edward.
47,John Cleese,Yes* Sir Edward.
48,John Cleese,Oh*
49,John Cleese,up.
50,Michael Palin,Sir Edward...Ross. Now* later in the programme we will be bringing you a unique event in the world of modern art. Pablo Picasso will be doing a special painting for us* on this programme* live* on a bicycle. But right now it's time to look at a man whose meteoric rise to fame...
51,John Cleese,Are you having any trouble from him?
52,John Cleese,Exactly. Well we interviewers are more than a match for the likes of you* 'Two Sheds'.
53,John Cleese,Get your own Arts programme* you fairy!
54,John Cleese,Oh* Michael* you are such a comfort.
55,Michael Palin,Arthur 'Two Sheds'...
56,John Cleese,...Jackson.
57,Michael Palin,And now for more news of the momentous artistic event in which Pablo Picasso is doing a specially commissioned painting for us whilst riding a bicycle. Pablo Picasso - the founder of modern art - without doubt the greatest abstract painter ever... for the first time painting in motion. But first of all let's have a look at the route he'll be taking.
58,Michael Palin,Well Picasso will be starting* David* at Chichester here* he'll then cycle on the A29 to Fontwell* he'll then take the A272 which will bring him on to the A3 just north of Hindhead here. From then on Pablo has a straight run on the A3 until he meets the South Circular at Battersea here. Well* this is a truly remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of such stature has taken the A272* and it'll be very interesting to see how he copes with the heavy traffic round Wisborough Green. Vicky.
59,Michael Palin,And now for the latest report on Picasso's progress over to Reg Moss on the Guildford by-pass.
60,Michael Palin,Well* we've just heard that Picasso is approaching the Tolworth roundabout on the A3 so come in Sam Trench at Tolworth.
61,John Cleese,Well something certainly is happening here at Tolworth roundabout* David. I can now see Picasso* he's cycling down very hard towards the roundabout* he's about 75-50 yards away and I can now see his painting... it's an abstract... I can see some blue some purple and some little black oval shapes... I think I can see...
62,Michael Palin,That's not Picasso - that's Kandinsky.
63,John Cleese,Piet Mondrian - just behind* Piet Mondrian the Neo-Plasticist* and then a gap* then the main bunch* here they come* Chagall* Max Ernst* Miro* Dufy* Ben Nicholson* Jackson Pollock and Bernard Buffet making a break on the outside here* Brancusi's going with him* so is Gericault* Ferdinand Leger* Delaunay* De Kooning* Kokoschka's dropping back here by the look of it* and so's Paul Klee dropping back a bit and* right at the back of this group* our very own Kurt Schwitters..
64,Michael Palin,He's German!
65,John Cleese,But as yet absolutely no sign of Pablo Picasso* and so from Tolworth roundabout back to the studio.
66,Michael Palin,Well I think I can help you there Sam* we're getting reports in from the AA that Picasso* Picasso has fallen off...he's fallen off his bicycle on the B2127 just outside Ewhurst* trying to get a short cut through to Dorking via Gomslake and Peashall. Well* Picasso is reported to be unhurt* but the pig has a slight headache. And on that note we must say goodnight to you. Picasso has failed in his first bid for international cycling fame. So from all of us here at the 'It's the Arts' studio* it's goodnight. Goodnight.
67,Michael Palin,Porker* eh? Swine.
68,John Cleese,Vott is the big joke?
69,Michael Palin,I can only give you name* rank* and why did the chicken cross the road?
70,John Cleese,That's not funny!
71,John Cleese,I vant to know the joke.
72,Michael Palin,All right. How do you make a Nazi cross?
73,John Cleese,I don't know ... how do you make a Nazi cross?
74,Michael Palin,Tread on his corns.
75,John Cleese,Gott in Himmel! That's not funny!
76,John Cleese,Now if you don't tell me the joke* I shall hit you properly.
77,Michael Palin,I can stand physical pain* you know.
78,John Cleese,Ah ... you're no fun. All right* Otto.
79,Michael Palin,Oh no - anything but that please no* all right I'll tell you.
80,John Cleese,Quick Otto. The typewriter.
81,Michael Palin,Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! ... Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.
82,John Cleese,Ach! Zat iss not funny!
83,Michael Palin,It's...
84,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus.
85,John Cleese,Bonsoir - ici nous avons les diagrammes modernes d'un mouton anglo-français ... maintenant ... baa-aa* baa-aa... nous avons* dans la tête* le cabinc. Ici* on se trouve le petit capitaine Anglais* Monsieur Trubshawe.
86,Michael Palin,Vive Brian* wherever you are.
87,John Cleese,D'accord* d'accord. Maintenant* je vous présente mon collègue* le pouf célèbre* Jean-Brian Zatapathique.
88,Michael Palin,Maintenant* le mouton ... le landing ... les wheels* bon.
89,John Cleese,Bon* les wheels* ici.
90,Michael Palin,C'est formidable* n'est ce pas ...
91,John Cleese,Les voyageurs ... les bagages ... ils sont ... ici!
92,Michael Palin,All over yes.
93,John Cleese,So do I.
94,Michael Palin,Me too.
95,Michael Palin,Jean-Paul Sartre.
96,John Cleese,Good evening* I have with me* Mr Arthur Frampton* who has...Mr. Frampton* I understand that you...er...as it were...have er...well* let me put it another way...I believe Mr. Frampton that whereas most people have - er - two...two...you...you
97,John Cleese,Ah yes* yes I see...Um* Are you quite comfortable?
98,John Cleese,Er* Mr Frampton... vis-à-vis...your...rump.
99,John Cleese,Er* your rump.
100,John Cleese,Your posterior....derriere...sit upon.
101,John Cleese,...Buttocks.
102,John Cleese,Sshhh! Well Mr. Frampton I understand Mr Frampton* you have a... 50% bonus in the...in the region of what you said.
103,John Cleese,Yes* yes* Splendid* splendid. Well...we were wondering* Mr Frampton* if you...could...see your way clear...
104,John Cleese,Er* nothing* nothing at all* sir. We were wondering if you could see your way clear...to giving us...a quick... a quick... visual... Mr Frampton* will you take your trousers down?
105,John Cleese,Please take them down.
106,John Cleese,Just a little bit.
107,John Cleese,No* er ahem...
108,John Cleese,Now look here Mr Frampton... It's perfectly easy for somebody just to come along here to the BBC simply claiming... that they have a bit to spare in the botty department...but the point is Mr. Frampton... our viewers need proof.
109,John Cleese,How?
110,John Cleese,Good evening* I have with me* Mr Arthur Frampton* who... Mr. Frampton - I understand that you* as it were...well* let me put it another way...I believe Mr. Frampton that whereas most people...didn't we do this just now?
111,John Cleese,Well why didn't you
112,John Cleese,so?
113,John Cleese,He's not here yet!
114,Michael Palin,Ladies and gentlemen isn't she just great eh* wasn't she just great. Ha* ha* ha* and she can run as fast as she can sing* ha* ha* ha. And I'm telling you - 'cos I know. No* only kidding. Ha* ha* ha. Seriously now* ladies and gentlemen* we have for you one of the most unique acts in the world today. He's...well I'll say no more* just let you see for yourselves...ladies and gentlemen* my very great priviledge to introduve Arthur Ewing* and his musical mice.
115,Michael Palin,Are you the marriage guidance counsellor?
116,Michael Palin,Good morning* sir
117,Michael Palin,Mr and Mrs Arthur Pewtey* Pewtey.
118,Michael Palin,It's Deirdre
119,Michael Palin,Well* it all started about five years ago when we started going on holiday to Brighton together. Deirdre* that's my wife* has always been a jolly good companion to me and I never particularly anticipated any marital strife - indeed the very idea of consulting a professional marital adviser has always been of the greatest repugnance to me although far be it from me to impugn the nature of your trade or profession
120,Michael Palin,Well* as I say* we've always been good friends* sharing the interests* the gardening and so on* the model aeroplanes* the sixpenny bottle for the holiday money* and indeed twice a month settling down in the evenings doing the accounts* something which* er* Deirdre* Deirdre that's my wife* er* particularly looked forward to on account of her feet
121,Michael Palin,I should probably have said at the outset that I'm noted for having something of a sense of humour* although I have kept myself very much to myself over the last two years notwithstanding* as it were* and it's only as comparatively recently that I began to realize - well* er prehaps realize is not the correct word* er* imagine* imagine* that I was not the only thing in her life
122,Michael Palin,Well yes - at first* frankly yes
123,Michael Palin,Her behaviour did seem at the time to me* who after all was there to see* to be a little odd.
124,Michael Palin,Yes well* I mean to a certain extent yes. I'm not by nature a suspicious person - far from it - though in fact I have something of a reputation as an after-dinner speaker* if you take my meaning....
125,Michael Palin,Anyway in the area where I'm known people in fact know me extremely well....
126,Michael Palin,Certainly yes
127,Michael Palin,Anyway* as I said* I decided to face up to the facts and stop beating about the bush or I'd never look myself in the bathroom mirror again.
128,Michael Palin,No* no* right-ho* fine. Yes I'll wait outside shall I?...
129,Michael Palin,Yes* well that's p'raps the best things. Yes. You've certainly put my mind at rest on one or two points* there.
130,John Cleese,Now wait there stranger. A man can run and run for year after year until he realizes      that what he's running from...is hisself
131,Michael Palin,Gosh.
132,John Cleese,A man's got to do what a man's got to do* and there ain't no sense in runnin'. Now      you gotta turn* and you gotta fight* and you gotta hold your head up high.
133,Michael Palin,Yes!
134,John Cleese,Now you go back in there my son and be a man. Walk tall.
135,Michael Palin,Yes* I will. I will. I've been pushed around long enough. This is it. This is your monent Arthur Pewtey - this is it Arthur Pewtey. At last you're a man!
136,Michael Palin,All right* Dierdre* come out of there
137,Michael Palin,Right. Right.
138,John Cleese,So much for pathos.
139,John Cleese,These historic pictures of Queen Victoria* taken in 1880 at Osborne show the Queen with Gladstone. This unique film provides a rare glimpse into the private world of a woman who ruled half the earth. The commentary* recorded on the earliest wax cylinders* is spoken by Alfred Lord Tennyson* the Poet Laureate.
140,Michael Palin,Well hello* it's the wacky Queen again!
141,Michael Palin,Well* that's one way to get the housework done!
142,Michael Palin,Oh shut up!
143,Michael Palin,And now for something completely different ... a man with three buttocks...
144,Michael Palin,Oh all right. All right! A man with nine legs.
145,John Cleese,He ran away.
146,Michael Palin,Oh... Bloody Hell! Er ... a Scotsman on a horse!
147,Michael Palin,Harold! Come back* Harold! Harold! Come back* Harold! Oh* blast!
148,John Cleese,Good evening* and welcome once again to the Epilogue. On the programme this evening we have Monsignor Edward Gay* visiting Pastoral Emissary of the Somerset Theological College and author of a number of books about belief* the most recent of which is the best seller 'My God'. And opposite him we have Dr Tom Jack: humanist* broadcaster* lecturer and author of the book 'Hello Sailor'. Tonight* instead of discussing the existence or non-existence of God* they have decided to fight for it. The existence* or non-existence* to be determined by two falls* two submissions* or a knockout. All right boys* let's get to it. Your master of ceremonies for this evening - Mr Arthur Waring.
149,John Cleese,Now Dr Jack's got a flying mare there. A flying mare there* and this is going to be a full body slam. A full body slam* and he's laying it in there* and he's standing back. Well .. there we are leaving the Epilogue for the moment* we'll be bringing you the result of this discussion later on in the programme.
150,John Cleese,Oh my God!
151,Michael Palin,Yes. The Mouse Problem. This week 'The World Around Us' looks at the growing social phenomenon of Mice and Men. What makes a man want to be a mouse.
152,John Cleese,Well it's not a question of wanting to be a mouse... it just sort of happens to you. All of a sudden you realize... that's what you want to be.
153,John Cleese,Well... I was about seventeen and some mates and me went to a party* and* er...      we had quite a lot to drink... and then some of the fellows there ... started handing ... cheese      around ... and well just out of curiosity I tried a bit ... and well that was that.
154,John Cleese,Well some of them started dressing up as mice a bit ... and then when they'd got      the costumes on they started ... squeaking.
155,John Cleese,That was all.
156,John Cleese,Well I was shocked. But* er... gradually I came to feel that I was more at ease ... with other mice.
157,Michael Palin,A typical case* whom we shall refer to as Mr A* although his real name is this:
158,Michael Palin,What is it that attracts someone like mr. A to this way of life? I have with me a consultant psychiatrist.
159,Michael Palin,Well* that's amazing* amazing. Thank you* Janet.
160,Michael Palin,Kargol* speaking as a psychiatrist as opposed to a conjuror...
161,Michael Palin,...what makes certain men want to be mice?
162,Michael Palin,The Amazing Kargol And Janet.  What a lot of people don't realize is that a mouse* once accepted* can fulfil a very useful role in society. Indeed there are examples throughout history of famous men now known to have been mice.
163,Michael Palin,And* of course* Hillaire Belloc. But what is the attitude...
164,Michael Palin,... this growing social problem?
165,John Cleese,Well speaking as a member of the Stock Exchange I would suck their brains out with a straw* sell the widows and orphans and go into South American Zinc.
166,John Cleese,I feel that these poor unfortunate people should be free to live the lives of their own choice.
167,Michael Palin,Clearly the British public's view is a hostile one.
168,Michael Palin,But perhaps this is because so little is generally known of these mice men. We have      some film now taken of one of the notorious weekend mouse parties* where these disgusting      little perverts meet.
169,Michael Palin,Mr A tells us what actually goes on at these mouse parties.
170,John Cleese,Well first of all you get shown to your own private hole in the skirting board... then you      put the mouse skin on... then you scurry into the main room* and perhaps take a run in the      wheel.
171,Michael Palin,The remainder of this film was taken secretly at one of these mouse parties by a      BBC cameraman posing as a vole. As usual we apologize for the poor quality of the film.
172,John Cleese,Well* er* then you steal some cheese* Brie or Camembert* or Cheddar or      Gouda* if you're on the harder stuff. You might go and see one of the blue cheese films...      there's a big clock in the middle of the room* and about 12:50 you climb up it and then      ...eventually* it strikes one... and you all run down.
173,Michael Palin,And what's that?
174,John Cleese,That's the farmer's wife.
175,Michael Palin,Perhaps we need to know more of these mice men before we can really judge      them. Perhaps not. Anyway* our thirty minutes are up.
176,Michael Palin,Goodnight.
177,John Cleese,And here is the result of the Epilogue: God exists by two falls to a submission
178,Michael Palin,It's...
179,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus.
180,John Cleese,EPISODE 12B'
181,John Cleese,The larch. The larch.
182,John Cleese,I'm sorry I'm late m'lud I couldn't find a kosher car park. Er... don't bother to recap m'lud* I'll pick it up as we go along. Call Mrs Fiona Lewis.
183,John Cleese,My next witness will explain that if m'ludship will allow. I call the late Arthur Aldridge.
184,John Cleese,Yes m'lud.
185,John Cleese,I beg your pardon m'lud.
186,John Cleese,Yes* m'lud. Er* well* er* virtually* m'lud.
187,John Cleese,No he's not completely dead m'lud. No. But he's not at all well.
188,John Cleese,Oh* it's purely a precaution m'lud - if I may continue? Mr Aldridge* you were a... you are a stockbroker of 10 Savundra Close* Wimbledon.
189,John Cleese,Mr Aldridge...
190,John Cleese,It means 'yes' m'lud. One knock for 'yes'* and two knocks for 'no'. If I may continue? Mr Aldridge* would it be fair to say that you are not at all well?
191,John Cleese,Ah ha!
192,John Cleese,That will become apparent in one moment m'lud.
193,John Cleese,No further questions m'lud.
194,John Cleese,There are no easy answers in this case m'lud.
195,John Cleese,M'lud the strange* damnable* almost diabolic threads of this extraordinary tangled web of intrigue will shortly m'lud reveal a plot so fiendish* so infernal* so heinous ...
196,John Cleese,Parking offence* schmarking offence* m'lud. We must leave no stone unturned. Call Cardinal Richelieu.
197,John Cleese,A character witness m'lud.
198,Michael Palin,Allo everyone* it's wonderful to be 'ere y'know* I just love your country. London is so beautiful at this time of year.
199,John Cleese,Er* you are Cardinal Armand du Piessis de Richelieu* First Minister of Louis XIII?
200,Michael Palin,Oui.
201,John Cleese,Cardinal* would it be fair to say that you not only built up the centralized monarchy in France but also perpetuated the religious schism in Europe?
202,Michael Palin,That's what they say.
203,John Cleese,Did you persecute the Huguenots?
204,John Cleese,And did you take even sterner measures against the great Catholic nobles who made common cause with foreign foes in defence of their feudal independence?
205,Michael Palin,I sure did that thing.
206,John Cleese,Cardinal. Are you acquainted with the defendant* Harold Larch?
207,Michael Palin,Since I was so high
208,Michael Palin,.
209,John Cleese,Speaking as a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church* as First Minister of Louis XIII* and as one of the architects of the modern world already - would you say that Harold Larch was a man of good character?
210,Michael Palin,Listen. Harry is a very wonderful human being.
211,John Cleese,M'lud. In view of the impeccable nature of this character witness may I plead for clemency.
212,Michael Palin,Bonjour Monsieur Dim.
213,Michael Palin,That is correct.
214,Michael Palin,Curse you Inspector Dim. You are too clever for us naughty people.
215,Michael Palin,It's a fair cop.
216,John Cleese,My you're clever Dim. He'd certainly taken me in.
217,John Cleese,NO. 1'
218,John Cleese,The larch. The larch.
219,John Cleese,AND NOW...NO. 1...THE LARCH...AND NOW...'
220,John Cleese,This man is no ordinary man. This is Mr. F. G. Superman. To all appearances* he looks like any other law-abiding citizen.
221,John Cleese,But Mr F. G. Superman has a secret identity...when trouble strikes at any time...at any place...he is ready to become... Bicycle Repair Man!
222,Michael Palin,Hmmmmm. Thinks - this sounds like a job for... Bicycle Repair Man...but how to change without revealing my secret identity?
223,John Cleese,If only Bicycle Repair Man were here!
224,Michael Palin,Yes. Wait! I think I know where I can find him - look over
225,Michael Palin,!
226,John Cleese,Oh look - is it a Stockbroker?
227,John Cleese,See! How he uses a spanner to tighten that nut!
228,Michael Palin,Oh* you don't need to guv* it's all right* it's all in a days work for... Bicycle Repair Man!
229,John Cleese,Yes! Whenever bicycles are broken* or menaced by International Communism* Bicycle Repair Man is ready!
230,John Cleese,Ready to smash the communists* wipe them up* and shove them off the face of the earth...
231,John Cleese,Kill! Kill! Kill! The filthy bastard commies* I hate 'em! I hate 'em! Aaargh! Aaargh!
232,John Cleese,Coming dear!
233,Michael Palin,Hello again* now here's a little sketch by two boys from London town. They've been writing for three years and they've called this little number - here it is* it's called - Restaurant sketch.
234,Michael Palin,Excuse me monsieur and madame.
235,Michael Palin,It's filthy* Gaston ... find out who washed this up* and give them their cards immediately.
236,Michael Palin,Better still* we can't afford to take any chances* sack the entire washing-up staff.
237,Michael Palin,Oh* no please* no trouble. It's quite right that you should point these kind of things out. Gaston* tell the manager what has happened immediately!
238,Michael Palin,Please* it's no fuss. I quite simply wish to ensure that nothing interferes with your complete enjoyment of the meal.
239,Michael Palin,I know. And I'm sorry* bitterly sorry* but I know that... no apologies I can make can alter the fact that in our restaurant you have been given a dirty* filthy* smelly piece of cutlery...
240,Michael Palin,It was smelly* and obscene and disgusting and I hate it* I hate it *.. nasty* grubby* dirty* mingy* scrubby little fork. Oh ... oh . . . oh . . .
241,Michael Palin,Easy* Mungo* easy... Mungo...
242,Michael Palin,the war wound!... the wound... the wound...
243,John Cleese,They've destroyed him! He's dead!! They killed him!!!
244,Michael Palin,Well* there we are then* that was the restaurant sketch* a nice little number...a bit vicious in parts* but a lot of fun...but how about that punch line* eh?...Oh* you know what I mean - oh...oh...really.
245,John Cleese,Good evening* here is the 6 o'clock News read by Michael Queen. It's been a quite day over most of the country as people went back to work after the warmest July weekend for nearly a year. The only high spot of the weekend was the meeting between officials of the NEDC and the ODCN in Bradford today.
246,John Cleese,In Geneva* officials of the Central Clearing Banks met with Herr Voleschtadt of Poland to discuss non-returnable loans on a twelve-year trust basis for the construction of a new zinc-treating works in the Omsk area of Krakow* near the Bulestan border. The Board of Trade has ratified a Trade Agreement with the Soviet Union for the sale of 600 low gear electric sewing machines. The President of the Board of Trade said he hoped this would mark a new area of expansion in world trade and a new spirit of co-operation between East and West. There has been a substantial drop in Gold Reserves during the last twelve months. This follows a statement by the Treasury to the effect that the balance of imports situation had not changed dramatically over the same period.
247,John Cleese,In the match between Glamorgan and Yorkshire* the Yorkshire bowler Nicholson took eight wickets for three runs. Glareorgan were all out for the thirty-six and therefore won the match by an innings and seven runs. Weather for tomorrow will be cloudy with occasional outbreaks of rain. And that is the end of the news.
248,John Cleese,AND NOW'
249,John Cleese,The larch
250,John Cleese,The horse chestnut.
251,John Cleese,Eric ... do you think you could recognize a larch tree?
252,John Cleese,What's your name?
253,Michael Palin,Michael.
254,John Cleese,Michael* do you think you know what a larch tree looks like?
255,Michael Palin,I want to go home.
256,John Cleese,Are there any other trees that any of you think you could recognize from quite a long way away?
257,John Cleese,What?
258,John Cleese,A sketch?
259,Michael Palin,Nudge nudge* Eric's written ...
260,John Cleese,The Larch.
261,Michael Palin,It's...
262,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
263,John Cleese,Allo* Marge!
264,John Cleese,Fancy seeing you! How's little Ralph?
265,John Cleese,Same as my Kevin.
266,John Cleese,Nothing but trouble ... leave it alone! He's just been in the Florentine Room and smeared tomato ketchup all over Raphael's Baby Jesus.
267,John Cleese,Put that Baroque masterpiece down!
268,John Cleese,Just like my Kevin. Show him an exhibition of early eighteenth-century Dresden Pottery and he goes berserk. No* I said no* and I meant no!
269,John Cleese,This morning we were viewing the early Flemish Masters of the Renaissance and Mannerist Schools* when he gets out his black aerosol and squirts Vermeer's Lady At A Window!
270,John Cleese,that if he spits at a painting I'll never take him to an exhibition again.
271,John Cleese,Now don't do a thing with it love* just put it in the bin over there.
272,John Cleese,Yes take my word for it* Marge. Kevin's eaten most of the early nineteenth-century British landscape artists* and I've learned not to worry. As a matter of fact* I feel a bit peckish myself.
273,John Cleese,Yes...
274,John Cleese,No ... I don't know much about art* but I know what I like.
275,Michael Palin,Urgh! I've got Vermeer all down my shirt...
276,Michael Palin,What a terrible joke.
277,Michael Palin,All right! All right! But you didn't have to say it! You could have kept quiet for a change!
278,Michael Palin,Oh* that's typical. Talk talk talk. Natter natter natter!
279,John Cleese,Sir! Good evening* class.
280,John Cleese,Where's all the others* then?
281,John Cleese,I can see that. What's the matter with them?
282,John Cleese,Flu...flu? They should eat more fresh fruit.
283,John Cleese,Right. Now* self-defence. Tonight I shall be carrying on from where we got to last week when I was showing you how to defend yourselves against anyone who attacks you with armed with a piece of fresh fruit.
284,Michael Palin,You promised you wouldn't do fruit this week.
285,John Cleese,What do you mean?
286,John Cleese,What's wrong with fruit? You think you know it all* eh?
287,Michael Palin,But couldn't we do something else* for a change?
288,John Cleese,What?
289,Michael Palin,We done oranges* apples* grapefruits.
290,Michael Palin,Pomegranates* greengages.
291,Michael Palin,Lemons.
292,John Cleese,How about cherries?
293,John Cleese,Red
294,John Cleese,black?
295,John Cleese,All right then...bananas!
296,John Cleese,We haven't done them* have we?
297,John Cleese,Right! Bananas! How to defend yourself against a man armed with a banana.
298,John Cleese,Now* it's quite simple to defend yourself against the banana fiend. First of all* you force him to drop the banana* next* you eat the banana* thus disarming him. You have now rendered him helpless.
299,Michael Palin,Suppose he's got a bunch.
300,John Cleese,Shut up!
301,John Cleese,Shut up. Right now you* Mr Apricot.
302,John Cleese,Harrison* Mr. Harrison. Come at me with that banana then. Come on attack me with it. As hard as you like. Come on.
303,John Cleese,Now...I eat the banana.
304,John Cleese,I have now eaten the banana. The deceased Mr Apricot is now disarmed.
305,Michael Palin,You shot him. You shot him dead.
306,John Cleese,Well* he was attacking me with a banana.
307,John Cleese,Look* I'm only doing me job. I have to show you how to defend yourselves against fresh fruit.
308,John Cleese,Shut up.
309,Michael Palin,Supposing someone came at you with a banana and you haven't got a gun?
310,John Cleese,Run for it.
311,John Cleese,You try that with a pineapple down your windpipe.
312,John Cleese,Where? Where?
313,John Cleese,Oh blimey. I thought my number was on that one.
314,John Cleese,Oh. Oh. Right. That's the banana then. Next... the raspberry.
315,John Cleese,Harmless looking thing* isn't it? Now you* Mr Tinned Peach...
316,John Cleese,Mr Thompson* come at me with that raspberry then. Come on* be as vicious as you like with it.
317,John Cleese,Why not?
318,John Cleese,I won't.
319,John Cleese,That was self-defence. Come on. I promise I won't shoot you.
320,John Cleese,Shut up. Now. Brandish that...brandish that raspberry. Come on* be as vicious as you like with it. Come on.
321,John Cleese,I haven't got a gun.
322,John Cleese,I haven't.
323,John Cleese,Oh...
324,John Cleese,gun.
325,John Cleese,All right.
326,John Cleese,How to defend yourself against a raspberry* without a gun.
327,John Cleese,I wasn't.
328,John Cleese,Wasn't. Come on* come on you worm...you miserable little man. Come at me then...come on* do your worst* you worm.
329,John Cleese,If anyone ever attacks you with a raspberry* simply pull the lever...and a sixteen-ton weight will drop on his head. I learnt that in Malaya.
330,Michael Palin,Suppose you haven't got a sixteen-ton weight?
331,John Cleese,Well that's planning* isn't it? Forethought.
332,Michael Palin,How many sixteen-ton weights are there?
333,John Cleese,Look...look* smarty pants* the sixteen-ton weight is just one way of dealing with the raspberry killer. There are millions of others!
334,John Cleese,Shoot him.
335,Michael Palin,Well* supposing you haven't got a gun or a sixteen-ton weight?
336,John Cleese,All right clever dick* all right clever dick. You two* come at me with raspberries* there you are* a whole basket each. Come on* come at me with them* then.
337,Michael Palin,No gun?
338,John Cleese,No.
339,Michael Palin,No sixteen-ton weight?
340,Michael Palin,No rocks up in the ceiling?
341,Michael Palin,You won't kill us.
342,John Cleese,I won't kill you.
343,Michael Palin,Promise.
344,John Cleese,I promise I won't kill you. Now* are you going to attack me?
345,John Cleese,Right* now don't rush me this time. I'm going to turn me back. So you can stalk me...right. Come up as quietly as you can* right* close up behind me* then* in with the raspberries* right? Start moving
346,John Cleese,Right...I know you're there - lurking under the floorboards with your damsons and your prunes...now* the rest of you - I know you're hiding behind the wall bars with your quinces. Well I'm ready for you. I've wired myself up to two hundred tons of gelignite* and if any one of you so much as tries anything we'll all go up together! I've warned you...I warned you* right. That's it...
347,John Cleese,Yes* you know it's a man's life in England's Mountain Green.
348,John Cleese,What about my rustic monologue?...I'm not sleeping with
349,John Cleese,producer again.
350,John Cleese,Excitement* drama* action* violence* fresh fruit. Passion. Thrills. Spills. Romance. Adventure* all the things you can read about in a book.
351,John Cleese,Er... oh!
352,John Cleese,Oh* well I'm afraid we don't have any.
353,John Cleese,We don't have any books. We're fresh out of them. Good morning.
354,John Cleese,All what? Oh! All these* ah ah ha ha. Your referring to these ... books.
355,John Cleese,They're um ... they're all sold. Good morning.
356,John Cleese,Every single man Jack of them. Not a single one of them in an unsold state. Good morning.
357,John Cleese,What?
358,John Cleese,Oh ... various ... good Lord is that the time? Oh my goodness I must close for lunch.
359,John Cleese,Ah yes* well I feel rather peckish ... very peckish actually* I don't expect I'll open again today. I think I'll have a really good feed. I say! Look at that lovely bookshop just across the road there* they've got a much better selection than we've got* probably at ridiculously low prices ... just across the road there.
360,John Cleese,Good morning.
361,John Cleese,Er .*. oh . .. I was just saying ... thinking of the weather.. I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year... and so are the mangoes.
362,John Cleese,Go on...
363,John Cleese,Go on - mine aren't ... but...
364,John Cleese,Aren't you going to say something about 'mine aren't but the Big Cheese gets his at low tide tonight'?
365,John Cleese,Oh* ah* good morning*
366,John Cleese,Wait. Who sent you?
367,John Cleese,She didn't have a duelling scar just here ... and a hook?
368,John Cleese,Of course not* I was thinking of somebody else. Good morning.
369,John Cleese,What* where? You didn't see anything did you?
370,John Cleese,No no* well there's nothing going on here at all
371,John Cleese,and he didn't see anything. Good morning.
372,John Cleese,Look there is nothing going on. Please believe me* there is abso...
373,John Cleese,. . . lutely nothing going on. Is there anything going on?
374,John Cleese,See there's nothing going on.
375,John Cleese,That was my aunt* look what was this book you wanted then? Quickly! Quickly!
376,John Cleese,My God you've got guts.
377,John Cleese,Just how much do you know?
378,John Cleese,Are you from the British Dental Association?
379,John Cleese,Get away from that door.
380,John Cleese,Stay where you are. You'll never leave this bookshop alive.
381,John Cleese,You know too much* my dental friend.
382,John Cleese,Come clean. You're a dentist aren't you.
383,John Cleese,A tobacconist who just happens to be buying a book on ...teeth?
384,John Cleese,Ha ha ha ha...
385,Michael Palin,Drop that gun* Stapleton.
386,John Cleese,Lafarge!
387,John Cleese,No there isn't.
388,Michael Palin,OK Stapleton* this is it. Where's Mahoney hidden the fillings?
389,John Cleese,What fillings?
390,Michael Palin,You know which fillings* Stapleton. Upper right two and four* lower right three and two lower left one. Come on.
391,Michael Palin,Remember what happened to Nigel.
392,John Cleese,Orthodontic Jake gave him a gelignite mouth wash.
393,John Cleese,Well there isn't.
394,Michael Palin,Come on Stapleton. The fillings!
395,John Cleese,They're at 22 Wimpole Street.
396,Michael Palin,Don't play games with me!
397,John Cleese,Oh* oh* 22a Wimpole Street.
398,Michael Palin,That's better.
399,John Cleese,But you'll need an appointment.
400,Michael Palin,OK
401,Michael Palin,Brian! Make with the appointment baby. No gas.
402,Michael Palin,Van der Berg!
403,John Cleese,That's Van der Berg. He's on our side.
404,John Cleese,Me?
405,John Cleese,You dirty double-crossing rat.
406,John Cleese,He's two-timed me.
407,John Cleese,The five seconds haven't started yet have they?
408,Michael Palin,Bronski?
409,Michael Palin,It's...
410,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
411,Michael Palin,Oh good* that'll be the Vet* dear.
412,Michael Palin,Oh very glad indeed you could come round* sir.
413,Michael Palin,Well...
414,Michael Palin,Oh* no!
415,Michael Palin,And at night.
416,Michael Palin,And his milk.
417,Michael Palin,Well we ...
418,Michael Palin,Sh! What?
419,Michael Palin,Confuse-a-Cat Limited'.'
420,Michael Palin,Squad! Eyes front! Stand at ease. Cat confusers ...shun!
421,John Cleese,Well men* we've got a pretty difficult cat to confuse today so let's get straight on with it. Jolly good. Thank you sergeant.
422,Michael Palin,Confusers attend to the van and fetch out... wait for it... fetch out the funny things.
423,Michael Palin,Move* move* move. One* two* one* two* get those funny things off.
424,Michael Palin,Stage ready for confusing* sir!
425,John Cleese,Very good. Carry on* sergeant.
426,Michael Palin,Left turn* double march!
427,John Cleese,Right men* confuse the ... cat!
428,John Cleese,I hope to God it works. Anyway* we shall know any minute now.
429,Michael Palin,Neither can I. It's just like the old days.
430,Michael Palin,What can we ever do to repay you?
431,John Cleese,No need to* sir. It's all in a day's work for 'Confuse-a-Cat'.
432,John Cleese,Have you read this* sir?
433,Michael Palin,No! Oh* yes* yes - yes.
434,John Cleese,Anything to declare?
435,Michael Palin,Yes ... no! No! No! No! Nothing to declare* no* nothing in my suitcase no...
436,John Cleese,No watches* cameras* radio sets?
437,Michael Palin,Oh yes ... four watches ... no* no* no. No. One... one watch...No* no. Not even one watch. No* no watches at all. No* no watches at all. No precision watches* no.
438,John Cleese,Which country have you been visiting* sir?
439,Michael Palin,Switzerland ... er ... no ... no ... not Switzerland ... er ... not Switzerland* it began with S but it wasn't Switzerland... oh what could it be? Terribly bad memory for names. What's the name of that country where they don't make watches at all?
440,John Cleese,Spain?
441,Michael Palin,Spain! That's it. Spain* yes* mm.
442,John Cleese,The label says 'Zurich'* sir.
443,Michael Palin,Yes well ... it
444,Michael Palin,Spain then.
445,John Cleese,Zurich's in Switzerland* sir.
446,Michael Palin,Switzerland* yes mm ... mm ... yes.
447,John Cleese,Switzerland - where they make the watches.
448,Michael Palin,Oh* nice shed you've got here.
449,John Cleese,Have you* er* got any Swiss currency* sir?
450,Michael Palin,No... just the watches... er just my watch* er* my watch on the currency... I've kept a watch on the currency* and I've watched it and I haven't got any.
451,John Cleese,That came out a bit glib didn't it?
452,John Cleese,Have you got an alarm clock in there* sir?
453,Michael Palin,No* no* heavens no* no... just vests.
454,John Cleese,Sounded a bit like an alarm going off.
455,Michael Palin,Well it can't have been... it must be a vest* er* going off.
456,John Cleese,Going off?
457,Michael Palin,All right* I confess* I'm a smuggler ... This whole case is crammed full of Swiss watches and clocks. I've been purposely trying to deceive Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. I've been a bloody fool.
458,John Cleese,I don't believe you* sir.
459,Michael Palin,It's true. I'm* er* guilty of smuggling.
460,John Cleese,Don't give me that* sir ... you couldn't smuggle a piece of greaseproof paper let alone a case full of watches.
461,Michael Palin,What do you mean! I've smuggled watches before* you know! I've smuggled bombs* cameras* microfilms* aircraft components* you name it - I've smuggled it.
462,John Cleese,Now come along please* you're wasting our time... move along please.
463,Michael Palin,Look!
464,Michael Palin,Look - look at this.
465,John Cleese,Look* for all I know* sir* you could've bought these in London before you ever went to Switzerland.
466,Michael Palin,What? I wouldn't buy two thousand clocks.
467,John Cleese,People do* now close your case move along please come on. Don't waste our time* we're out to catch the real smugglers. Come on.
468,John Cleese,Right* cut the wisecracks* vicar. Get to the search room* and strip.
469,John Cleese,Well* er* speaking
470,John Cleese,Wagh!
471,Michael Palin,What was the question again?
472,John Cleese,Just how relevant are contemporary customs regulations and currency restrictions in a modern expanding industrial economy?
473,John Cleese,Oh never mind.
474,John Cleese,I mean if I want to eat a squirrel now and again* that's me own business* innit? I mean* I'm no racialist. I* oh* oh...
475,John Cleese,Dear Freddy Grisewood* Bagshot* Surrey. As a prolific letter-writer* I feel I must protest about the previous letter. I am nearly sixty and am quite mad* but I do enjoy listening to the BBC Home Service. If this continues to go on unabated ...Dunkirk... dark days of the war... backs to the wall... Alvar Liddell ... Berlin air lift ... moral upheaval of Profumo case ... young hippies roaming the streets* raping* looting and killing. Yours etc.* Brigadier Arthur Gormanstrop (Mrs).
476,Michael Palin,Well that's* er* very interesting* because* er* I am* in fact* made entirely of wood.
477,John Cleese,Well I think they should attack the lower classes* er* first with bombs* and rockets destroying their homes* and then when they run helpless into the streets* er* mowing them down with machine guns. Er* and then of course releasing the vultures. I know these views aren't popular* but I have never courted popularity.
478,Michael Palin,I think there should be more race prejudice.
479,Michael Palin,Less race prejudice.
480,John Cleese,You know I really enjoy interviewing applicants for this management training course.
481,John Cleese,Ah. Come and sit down.
482,John Cleese,Take a seat.
483,John Cleese,Good morning.
484,John Cleese,Tell me why did you say 'good morning' when you know perfectly well that it's afternoon?
485,John Cleese,Good afternoon.
486,John Cleese,Oh dear.
487,John Cleese,Good evening.
488,John Cleese,Ha* ha. No.
489,John Cleese,Why do you think I rang the bell?
490,John Cleese,Five* four* three* two* one* zero!
491,John Cleese,Too late!
492,John Cleese,Goodnight* ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
493,John Cleese,Yes. Yes it is. Goodnight. Ding* ding* ding* ding* ding* ding* ding* ding.
494,John Cleese,Why do you say that?
495,John Cleese,Do you say it because you didn't know?
496,John Cleese,Five* four* three* two* one* zero! Right!
497,John Cleese,Well why do you think I did that then?
498,John Cleese,Aren't you curious?
499,John Cleese,Well* why didn't you ask me?
500,John Cleese,Name?
501,John Cleese,Your name man* your name!
502,John Cleese,David. Sure?
503,John Cleese,David Shaw.
504,John Cleese,Thomas Shaw?
505,John Cleese,Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding- ding-ding-ding. Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
506,John Cleese,Well do something. Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding* five* four* three* two* one . . .
507,John Cleese,Good!
508,John Cleese,Very good - do it again.
509,John Cleese,Goodnight* ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
510,John Cleese,You've got very good marks.
511,John Cleese,good marks.
512,John Cleese,Er* well* I'm afraid not. I'm afraid all the vacancies were filled several weeks ago.
513,Michael Palin,Well that was all good fun* and we all had a jolly good laugh* but I would like to assure you that you'd never be treated like that if you had an interview here at the Careers Advisory Board. Perhaps I should introduce myself. I am the Head of the Careers Advisory Board. I wanted to be a doctor* but there we are* I'm Head of the Careers Advisory Board.
514,Michael Palin,Never mind* now I wonder if you've ever considered what a very profitable line of work this man is in.
515,John Cleese,Yes?
516,John Cleese,What do you want?
517,John Cleese,Are you an encydopaedia salesman?
518,John Cleese,I think you're an encyclopaedia salesman.
519,John Cleese,If I let you in you'll sell me encyclopaedias.
520,John Cleese,Promise. No encyclopaedias?
521,John Cleese,All right.
522,John Cleese,You'd better come in then.
523,Michael Palin,That man was a successful encyclopaedia salesman. But not all encyclopaedia salesmen are successful. Here is an unsuccessful encyclopaedia salesman.
524,Michael Palin,Now here are two unsuccessful encyclopaedia salesmen.
525,Michael Palin,I think there's a lesson there for all of us.
526,Michael Palin,It's...
527,Michael Palin,I thought you did that so well Mr Figgis* could I have your autograph?

531,Michael Palin,All clear?
532,John Cleese,All clear* boss.
533,Michael Palin,Right ... this is the plan then. At 10:45 .. you* Reg* collect me and Ken in the van* and take us round to the British Jewellery Centre in the High Street. We will arrive outside the British Jewellery Centre at 10:50 a of m. I shall then get out of the car* you Reg* take it and park it back here in Denver Street* right? At 10:51* I shall enter the British Jewellery Centre* where you* Vic* disguised as a customer* will meet me and hand me £5.18.3d. At 10:52* I shall approach the counter and purchase a watch costing £5.18.3d. I shall then give the watch to you* Vic. You'll go straight to Norman's Garage in East Street. You lads continue back up here at 10:56 and we rendezvous in the back room at the Cow and Sickle* at 11:15. All right* any questions?
534,Michael Palin,What do you mean?
535,Michael Palin,Yes...
536,Michael Palin,for it* would they... eh?
537,Michael Palin,Why not?
538,Michael Palin,What d'you mean?
539,Michael Palin,What was wrong with that?
540,Michael Palin,Listen! What are you trying to say* Larry?
541,Michael Palin,Oh* you dumb cluck! We spent weeks organizing this job. Reg rented a room across the road and filmed the people going in and out every day. Vic spent three weeks looking at watch catalogues...until he knew the price of each one backwards* and now I'm not going to risk the whole raid just for the sake of breaking the law.
542,Michael Palin,No!
543,Michael Palin,What's the matter with you?
544,Michael Palin,Overdue?
545,Michael Palin,How much?
546,Michael Palin,Five minutes overdue. You fool! You fool! All right ... we've no time to lose. Ken - shave all your hair off* get your passport and meet me at this address in Rio de Janeiro Tuesday night. Vic - go to East Africa* have plastic surgery and meet me there. Reg - go to Canada and work your way south to Nicaragua by July. Larry - you stay here as front man. Give us fifteen minutes then blow the building up. All right* make it fast.
547,Michael Palin,Oh bloody hell. Well we'd better give ourselves up then.
548,Michael Palin,No I think being illegal makes it more exciting.
549,John Cleese,I agree. If there were fewer robbers there wouldn't be so many of them* numerically speaking.
550,Michael Palin,I think sexual ecstasy is over-rated.
551,Michael Palin,Well* how very interesting* because I'm now made entirely of tin.
552,John Cleese,After a few more of these remarks* I shall be appearing in a sketch* so stay tuned.
553,John Cleese,Hello again. I am at present still on film* but in a few seconds I shall be appearing in the studio. Thank you.
554,John Cleese,Mr Milton? You are sole proprietor and owner of the Whizzo Chocolate Company?
555,John Cleese,Superintendent Parrot and I are from the hygiene squad.We want to have a word with you about your box of chocolates entitled the Whizzo Quality Assortment.
556,John Cleese,If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the Cherry Fondue. This is extremely nasty* but we can't prosecute you for that.
557,John Cleese,Next we have number four* 'Crunchy Frog'.
558,John Cleese,Am I right in thinking there's a real frog in here?
559,John Cleese,What sort of frog?
560,John Cleese,Is it cooked?
561,John Cleese,What* a raw frog?
562,John Cleese,That's as may be* but it's still a frog!
563,John Cleese,Well don't you even take the bones out?
564,John Cleese,Superintendent Parrot ate one of those.
565,John Cleese,Well* the Superintendent thought it was an almond whirl. People won't expect there to be a frog in there. They're bound to think it's some sort of mock frog.
566,John Cleese,Nevertheless* I must warn you that in future you should delete the words 'crunchy frog'* and replace them with the legend* 'crunchy raw unboned real dead frog' if you want to avoid prosecution.
567,John Cleese,I'm not interested in your sales! I have to protect the general public! Now what about this one.
568,John Cleese,What sort of confection is this?
569,John Cleese,Larks vomit?
570,John Cleese,Well it don't say nothing about that here.
571,John Cleese,Wel I hardly think this is good enough. I think it's be more appropriate if the box bore a great red label warning lark's vomit.
572,John Cleese,Well why don't you move into more conventional areas of confectionary* like praline or lime cream; a very popular flavor* I'm lead to understand.
573,John Cleese,anthrax ripple! What's this one: 'spring surprise'?
574,John Cleese,Well where's the pleasure in that? If people place a nice chocky in their mouth* they don't want their cheeks pierced. In any case this is an inadequate description of the sweetmeat. I shall have to ask you to accompany me to the station.
575,John Cleese,Stop talking to the camera.
576,John Cleese,The BBC would like to apologize for the extremely poor quality of the next announcement* only he's not at all well.
577,Michael Palin,Ladies and gentlemen. Before the play starts* I would like to apologize to you all* but unfortunately Miss Cicely Courtneidge is unable to appear* owing to...
578,John Cleese,Yes! Policemen make wonderful friends. So if you are over six feet tall and would like a friend* a pen friend* in the police force* here is the address to write to: 'Mrs Ena Frog* 8 Masonic Apron Street* Cowdenbeath'. Remember - policemen make wonderful friends. So write today and take advantage of our free officer. Thank you. And now for the next sketch.
579,John Cleese,For Mrs Emma Hamilton of Nelson* a Scotsman on a horse.
580,Michael Palin,Yeah! Er ... yeah.
581,Michael Palin,Oh well you haven't told us... what it is yet...
582,Michael Palin,I like what he likes.
583,John Cleese,I like what he likes
584,John Cleese,Think of the colours!
585,John Cleese,It's where it's at!
586,Michael Palin,I like it* I like it.
587,Michael Palin,Yeah* yeah* I
588,Michael Palin,I like it
589,John Cleese,Well ... I think it's an excellent idea.
590,John Cleese,No* no* no* I mean there may be things against it.
591,John Cleese,No* no* I mean it takes time.
592,John Cleese,Yo. Nes. Perhaps.
593,Michael Palin,We dropped our pencils.
594,Michael Palin,Oh...
595,Michael Palin,I feel fine now.
596,Michael Palin,Yeah. Splunge for me too.
597,Michael Palin,Er... er... er... I can't take it anymore.
598,Michael Palin,It's...
599,John Cleese,Good evening. Tonight we're going to take a hard tough abrasive look at camel spotting. Hello.
600,John Cleese,Now tell me* what exactly are you doing?
601,John Cleese,Good. And how many camels have you spotted so far?
602,John Cleese,Nearly one?
603,John Cleese,Fine. And er how long have you been here?
604,John Cleese,So* in* er* three years you've spotted no camels?
605,John Cleese,A Yeti spotter* that must have been extremely interesting.
606,John Cleese,And have you seen them all?
607,John Cleese,Well* now tell me* what do you do when you spot a camel?
608,John Cleese,Camels don't have numbers.
609,John Cleese,What?
610,John Cleese,Well how do you tell if it's a dromedary?
611,John Cleese,Mr Sopwith* aren't you in fact a train spotter?
612,John Cleese,Don't you in fact spot trains?
613,John Cleese,If you can spot one.
614,Michael Palin,Lady Chairman* sir* shareholders* ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars* plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the Swiss branch* and in addition adding the debenture preference stock of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve currency account of seven and a half million* plus an upward expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira* due to a rise in capital investment of ten million pounds* this firm last year made a complete profit of a shilling.
615,Michael Palin,Er* roughly* yes sir.
616,Michael Palin,Well that's very kind of you sir* but I don't think I'm ready to be Chairman yet.
617,John Cleese,Wilkins* Wilkins. This shilling* is it net or gross?
618,Michael Palin,It's British sir.
619,Michael Palin,Yes* this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was swallowed up in tax.
620,John Cleese,Five pence of a
621,John Cleese,sixpence?
622,Michael Palin,Yes sir.
623,Michael Palin,That's right sir.
624,Michael Palin,... Er.
625,John Cleese,That makes you a penny short Wilkins. Where is it?
626,Michael Palin,... Erm.
627,Michael Palin,I embezzled it sir.
628,Michael Palin,Yes all of it.
629,John Cleese,You naughty person.
630,Michael Palin,It's my first. Please be gentle with me.
631,Michael Palin,Oh please* please.
632,Michael Palin,And they want to put the licence fee up?
633,Michael Palin,A little joke* a little jest. Nothing to worry about ladies and gentlemen. Now we've got some science fiction for you* some sci-fi* something to send the shivers up your spine* send the creepy crawlies down your lager and limes. All the lads have contributed to it* it's a little number entitled* Science Fiction Sketch...
634,John Cleese,The Universe consists of a billion* billion galaxies... 77*000*000*000 miles across* and every galaxy is made up of a billion* zillion stars and around these stars circle a billion planets* and of all of these planets the greenest and the pleasantest is the planet Earth* in the system of Sol* in the Galaxy known as the Milky Way ... And it was to this world that creatures of an alien planet came ... to conquer and destroy the very heart of civilization...
635,John Cleese,... Harold Potter* gardener* and tax official* first victim of Creatures from another Planet.
636,John Cleese,Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The over-crowding was pitiful.
637,John Cleese,Three men to a caber.
638,John Cleese,For the few who remained* life was increasingly difficult.
639,John Cleese,Then suddenly a clue turned up in Scotland. Mr Angus Podgorny* owner of a Dunbar menswear shop* received an order for 48*000*000 kilts from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda.
640,Michael Palin,I'll have t'do it in two goes.
641,Michael Palin,Is that so?
642,Michael Palin,Aye ... but think o' the money dear ... £18.10.0d a kilt ...that's ...
643,Michael Palin,£900*000*000 - and that's without sporrans!
644,Michael Palin,Aye ... we'd be able to afford writing paper with our names on it... We'd be able to buy that extension to the toilet...
645,Michael Palin,Who?
646,Michael Palin,Och ... well ... he wasna really a man* d'you ken ...
647,Michael Palin,He was as strange a thing as ever I saw* or ever I hope to see* God willing. He was a strange unearthly creature - a quivering* glistening mass...
648,Michael Palin,He wasna so much a man as... a blancmange!
649,John Cleese,A blancmange* eh?
650,John Cleese,Hang on!
651,John Cleese,There's five.
652,John Cleese,Five people . . . how do you play doubles with five people?
653,John Cleese,Sounds a bit funny if you ask me ... playing doubles with five people...
654,John Cleese,Oh yes?
655,John Cleese,Look* are you asking me to believe that the five of you was playing doubles* when on the very next court there was a blancmange playing by itself?.
656,John Cleese,Well answer me this then - why didn't Jocasta play the blancmange at singles* while you and Sandra and Alec and David had a proper game of doubles with four people?
657,John Cleese,Call that friendship? Messing up a perfectly good game of doubles?
658,John Cleese,Look it's
659,John Cleese,affair if you want to play with five people ... but don't go calling it doubles. Look at Wimbledon* right? If Fred Stolle and Tony Roche played Charlie Pasarell and Cliff Drysdale and Peaches Bartcowitz... they wouldn't go calling it doubles.
660,John Cleese,That could play Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip.
661,Michael Palin,Aye!
662,Michael Palin,Aye* I did.
663,Michael Palin,I believe it.
664,Michael Palin,Och* woman* if a blancmange is prepared to come 2*200*000 light years to purchase a kilt* they must be fairly keen on kilts. So cease yer prattling woman and get sewing. This could be the biggest breakthrough in kilts since the Provost of Edinburgh sat on a spike. Mary* we'll be rich! We'll be rich!
665,Michael Palin,Ah mebbe not but he has gi' me this...
666,Michael Palin,An entry form for the British Open Tennis Championships at Wimbledon Toon ... signed and seconded.
667,Michael Palin,Aye* but I must go though dear* I dinna want to seem ungrateful.
668,Michael Palin,But I must.
669,Michael Palin,Oh* Mary...
670,Michael Palin,Oh* oh* Mary! Look out! Look out!
671,Michael Palin,Aye ... I'll ... do ... my best* sergeant.
672,Michael Palin,Er* detective inspector.
673,Michael Palin,Yes* sir.
674,Michael Palin,No* sir.
675,Michael Palin,Oh yes. That's the one that ate my Mary!
676,Michael Palin,But what about the 48*000*000 kilts and the Galaxy of Andromeda?
677,Michael Palin,Then you mean...
678,Michael Palin,But...
679,Michael Palin,Yes.
680,Michael Palin,Not?
681,Michael Palin,Why?
682,Michael Palin,Do you think?
683,Michael Palin,She was...
684,John Cleese,Yes it was Mr and Mrs Samuel Brainsample* who* after only a brief and misleadling appearance in the early part of the film* returned to save the Earth ... but why?
685,John Cleese,She makes blancmanages
686,John Cleese,size?
687,John Cleese,So the world was saved! And Angus Podgorny became the first Scotsman to win Wimbledon... fifteen years later.
688,Michael Palin,It's...
689,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
690,Michael Palin,Speaking as a public opinion poll* I've had enough of the permissive society.
691,John Cleese,In 1943* a group of British Army Officers working deep behind enemy lines* carried out one of the most dangerous and heroic raids in the history of warfare. But that's as maybe. And now . . .
692,John Cleese,Two civilian gentlemen to see you ... sir!
693,John Cleese,Mr Dino Vercotti and Mr Luigi Vercotti.
694,Michael Palin,You've ... you've got a nice army base here* colonel.
695,Michael Palin,We wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
696,Michael Palin,No* we prefer to stand* thank you* colonel.
697,Michael Palin,Ha ha ha* very good* colonel.
698,Michael Palin,Explain it to the colonel* Dino.
699,Michael Palin,Five hundred! Hey!
700,Michael Palin,Well everything breaks* don't it colonel.
701,Michael Palin,Oh dear.
702,Michael Palin,How many men you got here* colonel?
703,Michael Palin,Paratroops* Dino.
704,Michael Palin,Fires happen* colonel.
705,Michael Palin,Could save you a lot of bother.
706,Michael Palin,Well suppose some of your tanks was to get broken and troops started getting lost* er* fights started breaking out during general inspection* like.
707,Michael Palin,Whatever made you think that* colonel?
708,Michael Palin,We're your buddies* colonel.
709,Michael Palin,We can guarantee you that not a single armoured division will get done over for fifteen bob a week.
710,Michael Palin,Twelve and six.
711,Michael Palin,Eight and six ... five bob...
712,Michael Palin,It's only 'cos you couldn't think of a punch line.
713,Michael Palin,Full frontal nudity? Yes I'd do it* if it was valid. Or if the money was valid* and if it were a very small part.
714,Michael Palin,Good evening. I'd like to talk to you tonight about the place of the nude in my bed ... um ... in the history of my bed ... of art* of
715,Michael Palin,Oh hello there father* er confessor* professor* your honour* your grace ...
716,Michael Palin,What a terrible joke!
717,John Cleese,Oh dear* did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?
718,Michael Palin,Did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?
719,Michael Palin,Hey* everybody* somebody said mattress to Mr Lambert* twice.
720,John Cleese,I would only perform in a scene in which there was full frontal nudity.
721,Michael Palin,Hello* are you a hermit by any chance?
722,Michael Palin,Yes* I certainly am.
723,Michael Palin,Oh you know* the usual - people* chat* gossip* you know.
724,Michael Palin,Oh* up the goat track* first on the left.
725,Michael Palin,Yes they are* I've got a beauty.
726,Michael Palin,No* we've had ours insulated.
727,Michael Palin,Yes* I used birds' nests* moss and oak leaves round the outside.
728,Michael Palin,Oh it's a treat* it really is* 'cos otherwise those stone caves can be so grim.
729,Michael Palin,Oh yes.
730,Michael Palin,With the* er* green loin cloth?
731,Michael Palin,Oh I see* yes.
732,Michael Palin,Really?
733,John Cleese,Morning Frank.
734,Michael Palin,Oh well* Mr Robinson's cave's never been exactly nirvana has it?
735,Michael Palin,... on the end.
736,Michael Palin,Well why don't you try birds nests like I've done? Or else* dead bracken.
737,Michael Palin,Still there's one thing about being a hermit* at least you meet people.
738,Michael Palin,Oh well* bye for now Frank* must toddle.
739,John Cleese,Hello* I wish to register a complaint...Hello? Miss?
740,Michael Palin,What do you mean* miss?
741,John Cleese,Oh I'm sorry* I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint!
742,Michael Palin,Sorry* we're closing for lunch.
743,John Cleese,Never mind that* my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.
744,Michael Palin,Oh yes* the* the Norwegian Blue. What's wrong with it?
745,John Cleese,I'll tell you what's wrong with it* my lad. It's dead* that's what's wrong with it!
746,Michael Palin,No* no* it's resting* look!
747,John Cleese,Look my lad* I know a dead parrot when I see one* and I'm looking at one right now.
748,Michael Palin,No no sir. it's not dead. It's resting!
749,John Cleese,Resting?
750,Michael Palin,Yeah* remarkable bird* the Norwegian Blue* beautiful plumage* innit?
751,John Cleese,The plumage don't enter into it - it's stone dead.
752,Michael Palin,No* no - it's just resting!
753,John Cleese,All right then* if it's restin'* I'll wake him up!
754,John Cleese,Hello Polly! I've got a nice cuttlefish for you when you wake up* Polly Parrot!
755,Michael Palin,There* it moved!
756,John Cleese,No* he didn't. That was you pushing the cage!
757,Michael Palin,I did not.
758,John Cleese,Yes* you did!
759,John Cleese,Now that's what I call a dead parrot.
760,Michael Palin,No* no. It's stunned.
761,John Cleese,Look my lad* I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago* you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.
762,Michael Palin,It's probably pining for the fjords.
763,John Cleese,Pining for the fjords* what kind of talk is that? Look* why did it fall flat on its back the moment I got it home?
764,Michael Palin,The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on it's back! Beautiful bird* lovely plumage!
765,John Cleese,Look* I took the liberty of examining that parrot* and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.
766,Michael Palin,Well of course it was nailed there. Otherwise it would muscle up to those bars and voom.
767,John Cleese,Look matey
768,John Cleese,this parrot wouldn't voom if you put four thousand volts through it! It's bleedin' demised!
769,Michael Palin,It's not* it's pining!
770,John Cleese,It's not pining* it's passed on. This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker.This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life* it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot.
771,Michael Palin,Well* I'd better replace it* then.
772,John Cleese,If you want to get anything done in this country you've got to complain till you're blue in the mouth.
773,Michael Palin,Sorry guv* we're right out of parrots.
774,John Cleese,I see. I see. I get the picture.
775,Michael Palin,I got a slug.
776,John Cleese,Does it talk?
777,Michael Palin,Not really* no.
778,John Cleese,Well* it's scarcely a replacement* then is it?
779,Michael Palin,Listen* I'll tell you what*
780,Michael Palin,tell you what* if you go to my brother's pet shop in Bolton he'll replace your parrot for you.
781,John Cleese,Bolton eh?
782,Michael Palin,Yeah.
783,John Cleese,All right.
784,John Cleese,Er* excuse me. This is Bolton* is it?
785,Michael Palin,No* no it's* er* Ipswich.
786,John Cleese,I wish to make a complaint.
787,John Cleese,I beg your pardon.
788,John Cleese,Er* excuse me* this is irrelevant* isn't it.
789,John Cleese,Well I wish to make a complaint. I got on the Bolton train and found myself deposited here in Ipswich.
790,John Cleese,The pet shop owner's brother was lying.
791,John Cleese,If this is Bolton* I shall return to the pet shop.
792,John Cleese,I understand that this
793,John Cleese,Bolton.
794,Michael Palin,Yes.
795,John Cleese,Well* you told me it was Ipswich.
796,Michael Palin,It was a pun.
797,John Cleese,A pun?
798,Michael Palin,No* no* not a pun* no. What's the other thing which reads the same backwards as forwards?
799,John Cleese,A palindrome?
800,Michael Palin,Yes* yes.
801,John Cleese,It's not a palindrome. The palindrome of Bolton would be Notlob. It don't work.
802,Michael Palin,Look* what do you want.
803,John Cleese,No I'm sorry* I'm not prepared to pursue my line of enquiry any further as I think this is getting too silly.
804,Michael Palin,Well they come up to you* like* and push you - shove you off the pavement* like. There's usually four or five of them.
805,John Cleese,Well Mr Johnson's son Kevin* he don't go out any more. He comes back from wrestling and locks himself in his room.
806,John Cleese,David Hemmings appeared by permission of the National Forestry Commission.
807,Michael Palin,It's...
808,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
809,John Cleese,The llama is a quadruped which lives in the big rivers like the Amazon. It has two ears* a heart* a forehead* and a beak for eating honey. But it is provided with fins for swimming.
810,John Cleese,Llamas are dangerous* so if you see one where people are swimming* you shout...
811,John Cleese,And now for something completely different - a man with a tape recorder up his nose.
812,Michael Palin,And now for something completely different. The office of Sir George Head* OBE.
813,John Cleese,Next please.
814,John Cleese,One at a time please.
815,John Cleese,So there is. Take a . . .
816,John Cleese,Seat! Take a seat. So!
817,John Cleese,Yes.
818,John Cleese,Jolly good* jolly good.
819,John Cleese,And how about you?
820,John Cleese,Now let me fill you in. I'm leading this expedition and we're going to climb both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.
821,John Cleese,Well* that'll save a bit of time. Well done. Now the object of this expedition is to see if we can find any traces of last year's expedition.
822,John Cleese,Yes* my brother was leading that* they were going to build a bridge between the two peaks*
823,John Cleese,My idea I'm afraid. Now* I ought to tell you that I have practically everyone I need for this expedition ... so what special qualifications do you have?
824,John Cleese,Yes* you first.
825,John Cleese,Carry on.
826,John Cleese,Mountaineer? Mountaineer
827,John Cleese,where the devil are they* mound* mount... mountain... a mountaineer: 'two men skilled in climbing mountains'. Jolly good* well you're in. Congratulations* both of you. Well* er* what are your names?
828,John Cleese,Arthur Wilson* right well look* I'll call you
829,John Cleese,Arthur Wilson two* just to avoid confusion.
830,John Cleese,Yes* we are leading this expedition to Africa.
831,John Cleese,Good questions... shall I? Well we'll be leaving on January 22nd and taking the following routes.
832,John Cleese,The A23s through Purleys down on the main roads near Purbrights avoiding Leatherheads and then taking the A231s entering Rottingdeans from the North. From Rottingdeans we go through Africa to Nairobis. We take the South road out of Nairobis for about twelve miles and then ask.
833,John Cleese,Oh* yes I think most of them do down there.
834,John Cleese,Oh* well Matron's got a smattering.
835,John Cleese,Good God* I'd forgotten about her.
836,John Cleese,Well we've got the Arthur Brown twins* two botanists called Machin* the William Johnston brothers ...
837,John Cleese,No four of them* a pair of identical twins ... and a couple of the Ken Spinoza quads - the other two pulled out. And of course you two.
838,John Cleese,Well you two are* and we've got a brace of guides called Jimmy Blenkinsop... because Kilimanjaro is a pretty tricky climb you know* most of it's up until you reach the very very top* and then it tends to slope away rather sharply. But Jimmy's put his heads together and worked out a way up.
839,John Cleese,I don't believe you've met. Jimmy Blenkinsop - Arthur Wilson* Arthur Wilson -Jimmy Blenkinsop... Arthur Wilson two -James Blenkinsop one* James Blenkinsop one - Arthur Wilson two. Carry on Jimmies.
840,John Cleese,He'll be leading the first assault.
841,John Cleese,Oh dear.
842,John Cleese,Well how about you?
843,John Cleese,So are we.
844,John Cleese,And now for aomething completely different - a man with a tape recorder up his brother's nose.
845,John Cleese,AND NOW IN STEREO...'
846,Michael Palin,Ah ... good morning sir* good morning. I'll be with you in a minute.
847,Michael Palin,How... how would you like it* sir?
848,Michael Palin,How do you do that?
849,Michael Palin,It's not a ... razor cut?
850,Michael Palin,It's just a scissors.
851,Michael Palin,You wouldn't rather just have it combed* would you sir?
852,Michael Palin,You wouldn't rather forget all about it?
853,Michael Palin,Cut* cut* cut* blood* spurt* artery* murder* Hitchcock* Psycho... right sir ... well ...
854,Michael Palin,I'll just get everything ready. In the meanwhile perhaps you could fill in one of these.
855,Michael Palin,What?
856,Michael Palin,Yes* yes ... yes.
857,Michael Palin,Thank you.
858,Michael Palin,Right!
859,Michael Palin,Ha* ha* ha ... there* I've finished.
860,Michael Palin,I've finished cutting... cutting... cutting your hair. It's all done*
861,Michael Palin,I have! I did it very quickly... your honour...
862,Michael Palin,... sir...
863,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* I will* I'm going to cut your hair* sir. I'm going to start cutting your hair* sir* start cutting now!
864,Michael Palin,Nice day* sir*
865,Michael Palin,Did you see the match last night* sir?
866,Michael Palin,I thought Hurst played well sir.
867,Michael Palin,I thought Hurst played well.
868,Michael Palin,Can you put your head down a little* sir?
869,Michael Palin,I prefer to watch Palace nowadays.
870,Michael Palin,Oh! Sorry! Was that your ear?
871,Michael Palin,Yes* it's a nice spot* isn't it.
872,Michael Palin,It looks very nice sir.
873,Michael Palin,Right* that's the lot then.
874,Michael Palin,All right ... I confess I haven't cut your hair ... I hate cutting hair. I have this terrible un-un-uncontrollable fear whenever I see hair. When I was a kid I used to hate the sight of hair being cut. My mother said I was a fool. She said the only way to cure it was to become a barber. So I spent five ghastly years at the Hairdressers' Training Centre at Totnes. Can you imagine what it's like cutting the
875,Michael Palin,We'd sing ... sing ... sing.
876,Michael Palin,I cut down trees* I eat my lunch*
877,Michael Palin,I cut down trees* I skip and jump*
878,Michael Palin,I chop down trees* I wear high heels*
879,Michael Palin,...just like my dear Mama.
880,John Cleese,Dear Sir* I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about the song which you have just broadcast* about the lumberjack who wears women's clothes. Many of my best friends are lumberjacks and only a few of them are transvestites. Yours faithfully* Brigadier Sir Charles Arthur Strong (Mrs.) PS I have never kissed the editor of the Radio Times.
881,Michael Palin,So anyway* I became a barber.
882,Michael Palin,Yes* pity really* I always preferred the outdoor life. Hunting* shooting* fishing. Getting out there with a gun* slaughtering a few of God's creatures - that was the life. Charging about the moorland* blasting their heads off.
883,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
884,John Cleese,Good evening. My name is Equator* Mr Equator Equator. Like round the middle of the Earth* only with an L.
885,John Cleese,This is my wife Audrey* she smells a bit but she has a heart of gold.
886,John Cleese,Who's that then?
887,John Cleese,Who's the bird?
888,John Cleese,You got a nice pair there haven't you love.
889,John Cleese,Shut up you silly bitch* it was only a bit of fun.
890,John Cleese,Big gin please.
891,John Cleese,I told you to lay off the beans* you whore!
892,John Cleese,Button your lip you rat-bag.
893,John Cleese,It was rather witty* wasn't it? Where's my gin?
894,John Cleese,Oh* I took the liberty of inviting an old friend along* as his wife has just passed away* and he's somewhat distraught poor chap. I hope you don't mind.
895,John Cleese,Not too good is it? A pint of crème de menthe for my friend. Well how are you* you great poof?
896,John Cleese,Is he sexy?
897,Michael Palin,I had to bring the goat* he's not well. I only hope he don't go on the carpet.
898,John Cleese,Come on then love* drop 'em.
899,John Cleese,Blimey* she don't go much do she.
900,Michael Palin,The goat's just done a bundle.
901,John Cleese,I beg your pardon?
902,John Cleese,I don't much like the tone of your voice.
903,John Cleese,Right let's have a ding dong...
904,Michael Palin,It's...
905,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
906,Michael Palin,Ooh. Ooh.
907,Michael Palin,It's from the BBC. They want to know if I want to be in a sketch on telly.
908,Michael Palin,What? It's acting innit?
909,Michael Palin,Well I'm a plumber. I can't act.
910,Michael Palin,Well* they just want me to stand at a counter* and when the sketch starts I go out.
911,Michael Palin,Walk-on? That's a walk-off* that's what this is.
912,John Cleese,Well* where is he* George?
913,John Cleese,He bloody should have been.
914,Michael Palin,It just says 'We would like you to be in a sketch. You are standing at a counter. When the sketch starts you go off. Yours faithfully* Lord Hill.'
915,Michael Palin,Yeah* well* what about the cat?
916,Michael Palin,All right then* all right. Bye. Bye dear.
917,John Cleese,Good morning* I am a bank robber. Er* please don't panic* just hand over all your money.
918,John Cleese,Fine* fine* fine.
919,John Cleese,Adopt* adapt and improve. Motto of the round table. Well* um ... what have you got?
920,John Cleese,Fine* fine* fine* fine. No large piles of money in safes?
921,John Cleese,No deposit accounts?
922,John Cleese,No piles of cash in easy to carry bags?
923,John Cleese,No luncheon vouchers?
924,John Cleese,Fine* fine. Well* um... adopt* adapt and improve. Just a pair of knickers then please.
925,John Cleese,Well* er* thanks Tree. I've got to pay the rent.
926,John Cleese,Well I've just been starring in several major multi-million dollar international films* and* during breaks on the set* I've been designing a Cathedral* doing wonderful unpublicized work for charity* er* finishing my history of the world* of course* pulling the birds* er* photographing royalty on the loo* averting World War Three - can't be bad - and* er learning to read.
927,John Cleese,Ah Mr Anchovy. Do sit down.
928,Michael Palin,Thank you. Take the weight off the feet* eh?
929,John Cleese,Yes* yes.
930,Michael Palin,Lovely weather for the time of year* I must say.
931,John Cleese,Enough of this gay banter. And now Mr Anchovy* you asked us to advise you which job in life you were best suited for.
932,Michael Palin,That is correct* yes.
933,John Cleese,Well I now have the results here of the interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week* and from them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person that you are. And I think I can say* without fear of contradiction* that the ideal job for you is chartered accountancy.
934,Michael Palin,But I
935,Michael Palin,a chartered accountant.
936,John Cleese,Jolly good. Well back to the office with you then.
937,Michael Palin,No! No! No! You don't understand. I've been a chartered accountant for the last twenty years. I want a new job. Something
938,Michael Palin,.
939,John Cleese,Well chartered accountancy is rather exciting isn't it?
940,Michael Palin,Exciting? No it's
941,Michael Palin,. My God it's dull* it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and des-per-ate-ly DULL.
942,John Cleese,Well* er* yes Mr Anchovy* but you see your report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see* our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow* unimaginative* timid* lacking in initiative* spineless* easily dominated* no sense of humour* tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks* in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon.
943,Michael Palin,But don't you see* I came here to find a new job* a new life* a new
944,Michael Palin,to my existence. Can't you help me?
945,John Cleese,Well* do you have any idea of what you want to do?
946,Michael Palin,Yes* yes I have.
947,John Cleese,What?
948,Michael Palin,Lion taming.
949,John Cleese,Well yes. Yes. Of course* it's a bit of a jump isn't it? I mean* er* chartered accountancy to lion taming in one go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way
950,John Cleese,lion taming* say* via banking?
951,Michael Palin,No* no* no* no. No. I don't want to wait. At nine o'clock tomorrow I want to be in there* taming.
952,John Cleese,Fine* fine. But do you* do you have any qualifications?
953,Michael Palin,Yes* I've got a hat.
954,John Cleese,A hat?
955,Michael Palin,Yes* a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion tamer' in great big neon letters* so that you can tame them after dark when they're less stroppy.
956,John Cleese,I see* I see.
957,Michael Palin,And you can switch it off during the day time* and claim reasonable wear and tear as allowable professional expenses under paragraph 335C...
958,John Cleese,Yes* yes* yes* I do follow* Mr Anchovy* but you see the snag is... if I now call Mr Chipperfield and say to him* 'look here* I've got a forty-five-year-old chartered accountant with me who wants to become a lion tamer'* his first question is not going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort of experience you've had with lions.
959,Michael Palin,Well I ... I've seen them at the zoo.
960,John Cleese,Good* good* good.
961,Michael Palin,Lively brown furry things with short stumpy legs and great long noses. I don't know what all the fuss is about* I could tame one of those. They look pretty tame to start with.
962,John Cleese,And these* er* these lions ... how high are they?
963,Michael Palin,Well they're about so high* you know. They don't frighten me at all.
964,John Cleese,Really. And do these lions eat ants?
965,Michael Palin,Yes* that's right.
966,John Cleese,Er* well* Mr Anchovy ... I'm afraid what you've got hold of there is an anteater.
967,Michael Palin,A what?
968,John Cleese,An anteater. Not a lion. You see a lion is a huge savage beast* about five feet high* ten feet long* weighing about four hundred pounds* running forty miles per hour* with masses of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor-sharp claws that can rip your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson'* and they look like this.
969,John Cleese,Time enough I think for a piece of wood.
970,John Cleese,Now* shall I call Mr Chipperfield?
971,Michael Palin,Er* no* no* no. I think your idea of making the transition to lion taming via easy stages* say via insurance...
972,John Cleese,Or banking.
973,Michael Palin,Or banking* yes* yes* banking that's a man's life* isn't it? Banking* travel* excitement* adventure* thrills* decisions affecting people's lives.
974,John Cleese,Jolly good* well* er* shall I put you in touch with a bank?
975,Michael Palin,Yes.
976,John Cleese,Fine.
977,Michael Palin,Er... no* no* no. Look* er* it's a big decision* I'd like a couple of weeks to think about it... er... you know* don't want to jump into it too quickly. Maybe three weeks. I could let you know definitely then* I just don't want to make this definite decision. I'm er...
978,John Cleese,Well this is just one of the all too many cases on our books of chartered accountancy. The only way that we can fight this terrible debilitating social disease* is by informing the general public of its consequences* by showing young people that it's just not worth it. So* so please... give generously... to this address: The League for Fighting Chartered Accountancy* 55 Lincoln House* Basil Street* London* SW3.
979,John Cleese,Ron* now let's just get this quite clear - you're intending to jump across the English Channel?
980,John Cleese,And* er* just how far is that?
981,John Cleese,Er* that's to the beach at Calais?
982,John Cleese,Ron are you using any special techniques to jump this great distance?
983,John Cleese,I see. Er* Ron* what is the furthest distance that you've jumped* er* so far?
984,John Cleese,I see. Er* Ron* Ron* Ron* aren't you worried Ron* aren't you worried jumping twenty-six miles across the sea?
985,John Cleese,Well how is that?
986,John Cleese,I see. Well* er* thank you very much Ron and the very best of luck.
987,John Cleese,Mr Vercotti* er Mr Vercotti ... Mr Vercotti...
988,Michael Palin,What?
989,Michael Palin,I don't know what you're talking about.
990,John Cleese,Er* no* we're from the BBC* Mr Vercotti.
991,Michael Palin,Who?
992,John Cleese,The BBC.
993,Michael Palin,Oh* oh. I see. I thought* I thought you were the er . .. I like the police a lot* I've got a lot of time for them.
994,John Cleese,Mr* er* Mr Vercotti* what is your chief task as Ron's manager?
995,Michael Palin,Well my main task is* er* to fix a sponsor for the big jump.
996,John Cleese,And who is the sponsor?
997,Michael Palin,The Chippenham Brick Company. Ah* they* er* pay all the bills* er* in return for which Ron will be carrying half a hundredweight of their bricks.
998,John Cleese,I see. Well* er* it looks as if Ron is ready now. He's got the bricks. He's had his passport checked and he's all set to go. And he's off on the first ever cross-Channel jump.
999,John Cleese,Will Ron be trying the cross-Channel jump again soon?
1000,Michael Palin,No. No. I'm taking him off the jumps. Er* because I've got something lined up for Ron next week that I think is very much more up his street.
1001,John Cleese,Er* what's that?
1002,Michael Palin,Er* Ron is going to eat Chichester Cathedral.
1003,John Cleese,Well* there he goes* Ron Obvious of Neaps End* in an attempt which could make him the first man ever to eat an entire Anglican Cathedral.
1004,Michael Palin,Well* er* I think* David* this is something which Ron and myself are really keen on. Ron is going to tunnel from Godalming here to Java here.
1005,John Cleese,Java.
1006,Michael Palin,Yeah* er* I* I personally think this is going to make Ron a household name overnight.
1007,John Cleese,And how far has he got?
1008,Michael Palin,Er* well* he's quite far now* Dave* well on the way. Well on the way* yeah.
1009,John Cleese,Well where is he exactly?
1010,Michael Palin,Yeah.
1011,John Cleese,Where?
1012,Michael Palin,Oh* er* well* er* you know* it's difficult to say exactly. He's er* you know* in the area of er* Ron* how far have you got?
1013,Michael Palin,Yeah well keep digging lad* keep digging.
1014,John Cleese,Er* Mr Verccotti* what do you say to people who accuse you of exploiting Ron for your own purposes?
1015,Michael Palin,Well* it's totally untrue* David. Ever since I left Sicily I've been trying to do the best for Ron. I know what Ron wants to do* I believe in him and I'm just trying to create the opportunities for Ron to do the kind of things he wants to do.
1016,John Cleese,And what's he going to do today?
1017,Michael Palin,He's going to split a railway carriage with his nose.
1018,Michael Palin,The only difficult bit for Ron is getting out of the Earth's atmosphere. Er* once he's in orbit he'll be able to run straight to Mercury.
1019,Michael Palin,I am now extremely hopeful that Ron will break the world record for remaining underground. He's a wonderful boy this* he's got this really enormous talent* this really huge talent.
1020,John Cleese,Good morning* I'd like to buy a cat.
1021,Michael Palin,Certainly sir. I've got a lovely terrier.
1022,John Cleese,No* I want a cat really.
1023,Michael Palin,Oh yeah* how about that?
1024,John Cleese,No* that's the terrier.
1025,Michael Palin,Well* it's as near as dammit.
1026,John Cleese,Well what do you mean? I want a cat.
1027,Michael Palin,Listen* tell you what. I'll file its legs down a bit* take its snout out* stick a few wires through its cheeks. There you are* a lovely pussy cat.
1028,John Cleese,Its not a proper cat.
1029,Michael Palin,What do you mean?
1030,John Cleese,Well it wouldn't meow.
1031,Michael Palin,Well it would howl a bit.
1032,John Cleese,No* no* no* no. Er* have you got a parrot?
1033,Michael Palin,No* I'm afraid not actually guv* we're fresh out of parrots. I'll tell you what though ... I'll lop its back legs off* make good* strip the fur* stick a couple of wings on and staple on a beak of your own choice.
1034,Michael Palin,No problem. Lovely parrot.
1035,John Cleese,How long would that take?
1036,Michael Palin,Oh* let me see ... er* stripping the fur off* no legs ...
1037,Michael Palin,Harry ... can you do a parrot job on this terrier straight away?
1038,Michael Palin,Friday?
1039,John Cleese,No I need it for tomorrow. It's a present.
1040,Michael Palin,Oh dear* it's a long job. You see parrot conversion ... Tell you what though* for free* terriers make lovely fish. I mean I could do that for you straight away. Legs off* fins on* stick a little pipe through the back of its neck so it can breathe* bit of gold paint* make good ...
1041,John Cleese,You'd need a very big tank.
1042,Michael Palin,It's a great conversation piece.
1043,John Cleese,Yes* all right* all right ... but* uh* only if I can watch.
1044,John Cleese,Oh* I thought that was a bit predictable.
1045,John Cleese,Dear David Jacobs* East Grinstead* Friday. Why should I have to pay sixty-four guineas each year for my television licence when I can buy one for six. Yours sincerely* Captain R. H. Pretty. PS Support Rhodesia* cut motor taxes* save the Argylls* running-in please pass.
1046,Michael Palin,Dear Old Codgers* I am President of the United States of America* Yours truly* R. M. Nixon.
1047,Michael Palin,What's that* Vera?
1048,Michael Palin,Righto.
1049,John Cleese,Vera! How dare you!
1050,John Cleese,What's the meaning of this?
1051,John Cleese,Who is this?
1052,John Cleese,How do you do ...
1053,John Cleese,How could you do this to me* Vera ... after all we've been through? Dammit* I love you.
1054,Michael Palin,What's happening* Vera?
1055,John Cleese,Come to me Vera!
1056,Michael Palin,Yes ... right and right again.
1057,Michael Palin,Vera!
1058,Michael Palin,I distinctly heard a Mexican rhythm combo.
1059,Michael Palin,Hm. Well I'm going for a tinkle.
1060,John Cleese,I say. There's no one to react to.
1061,John Cleese,Oh sorry.
1062,Michael Palin,Sh! I think my wife is beginning to suspect something...
1063,Michael Palin,It's...
1064,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
1065,Michael Palin,Have you finished in there yet?
1066,John Cleese,Dear Sir* I object strongly to the obvious lavatorial turn this show has already taken. Why do we never hear about the good things in Britain* like Mary Bignall's wonderful jump in 1964? Yours etc.* Ken Voyeur.
1067,Michael Palin,Dear Sir* I object strongly to the letters on your programme. They are clearly not written by the general public and are merely included for a cheap laugh. Yours sincerely etc.* William Knickers.
1068,John Cleese,This house is surrounded. I'm afraid I must not ask anyone to leave the room. No* I must ask nobody ... no* I must ask everybody to... I must not ask anyone to leave the room. No one must be asked by me to leave the room. No* no one must ask the room to leave. I ... I ... ask the room shall by someone be left. Not. Ask nobody the room somebody leave shall I. Shall I leave the room? Everyone must leave the room... as it is... with them in it. Phew. Understand?
1069,John Cleese,Allow me to introduce myself. I'm afraid I must ask that no one leave the room. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector Tiger.
1070,John Cleese,Where? Where? What? Ah. Me Tiger. You Jane. Grrr. Beg your pardon* allow me to introduce myself I'm afraid I must ask that no one leave the room.
1071,John Cleese,Elementary. Since the body was found in this room* and no one has left it. Therefore ... the murderer must be somebody in this room.
1072,John Cleese,Somebody. In this room. Must the murderer be. The murderer of the body is somebody in this room* which nobody must leave... leave the body in the room not to be left by anybody. Nobody leaves anybody or the body with somebody. Everybody who is anybody shall leave the body in the room body. Take the tablets Tiger. Anybody
1073,John Cleese,Albody me introbody albodyduce.
1074,John Cleese,That's better* now I'm Inspector Tiger and I must ask that nobody leave the room.
1075,John Cleese,Now someone has committed a murder here* and that murderer is someone in this room. The question is ... who?
1076,John Cleese,No murder.
1077,John Cleese,Oh. I don't like it. It's too simple* too clear cut. I'd better wait.
1078,John Cleese,No* too simple* too clear cut.
1079,Michael Palin,Right* sir. Nobody leave the room ask shall - somebody I leave nobody in the room body shall* take the tablets Tigerbody. Alself me to my duce introlow left body in the roomself.
1080,John Cleese,Good evening Brian.
1081,John Cleese,Well Brian... I'm opening a boutique.
1082,John Cleese,I hit the ball first time and there it was in the back of the net.
1083,Michael Palin,Hello* good evening* and welcome to yet another edition of 'Interesting People'. And my first interesting person tonight is the highly interesting Mr Howard Stools from Kendal in Westmorland.
1084,Michael Palin,Good evening Mr Stools.
1085,Michael Palin,Mr Stools* what makes you particularly interesting?
1086,Michael Palin,Well that's
1087,Michael Palin,interesting* thank you for coming along on the show tonight Mr Stools.
1088,Michael Palin,Our next guest tonight has come all the way from Egypt* he's just flown into London today* he's Mr Ali Bayan* he's with us in the studio tonight and he's stark raving mad.
1089,Michael Palin,Mr Ali Bayan* stark raving mad. Now it's time for our music spot and we turn the spotlight tonight on the Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir*
1090,Michael Palin,with their fantastic arrangement of 'Men of Harlech' for bicycle bells only.
1091,Michael Palin,The Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir. Really interesting. Remember* if you're interesting and want to appear on this programme* write your name and address and your telephone number and send it to this address:
1092,Michael Palin,Thank you* thank you. Now here's an interesting person. Apart from being a full-time stapling machine* he can also give a cat influenza.
1093,Michael Palin,Well* you can't get much more interesting than that* or can you? With me now is Mr Thomas Walters of West Hartlepool who is totally invisible. Good evening* Mr Walters.
1094,Michael Palin,Mr Walters* are you sure you're invisible?
1095,Michael Palin,Well* Mr Walters* what's it like being invisible?
1096,Michael Palin,Well* whilst we've got interesting people* we met Mr Oliver Cavendish who...
1097,Michael Palin,Mr Oliver Cavendish of Leicester* who claims to be able to recite the entire Bible in one second* whilst being struck on the head with a large axe. Ha* ha* wow. We've since discovered that he was a fraud* yes a fraud* he did not in fact recite the entire Bible he merely recited the first two words* 'In the...' before his death.
1098,Michael Palin,Now it's time for 'Interesting Sport'* and this week it's all-in cricket* live from the Municipal Baths* Croydon.
1099,Michael Palin,With me now is Mr Ken Dove* twice voted the most interesting man in Dorking. Ken* I believe you're interested in shouting.
1100,John Cleese,Yes* I'm interested in shouting all right* by jove you certainly hit the nail on the head with that particular observation of yours then.
1101,Michael Palin,What does your wife think of this?
1102,John Cleese,Shut up!
1103,Michael Palin,That is Tiddles* I believe?
1104,Michael Palin,Yes* and what does she do?
1105,Michael Palin,By herself?
1106,Michael Palin,Well that's extremely interesting* Ladies and gentlemen - Mr Don Savage and Tiddles.
1107,John Cleese,I'm more interesting than a wet pussycat.
1108,Michael Palin,Yes* great* well now for the first lime on television 'Interesting People' brings you a man who claims he can send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.
1109,Michael Palin,Keith* you claim you can send bricks to sleep.
1110,Michael Palin,Entirely by hypnosis.
1111,John Cleese,You've injured Mr Stools!
1112,Michael Palin,Well* we have a brick here* Keith.
1113,Michael Palin,Perhaps you can send it to sleep for us...
1114,Michael Palin,How do you know?
1115,Michael Palin,Oh* I see - have we got a moving brick? Yes* we've got a moving brick* Keith* it's coming over now.
1116,Michael Palin,Very good* very good indeed.
1117,Michael Palin,Yes* Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.
1118,John Cleese,Mr Stools - speak to me* Howard.
1119,Michael Palin,Mr Keith Maniac of Guatemala... and now four tired undertakers.
1120,John Cleese,I've fallen off my chair* Brian.
1121,John Cleese,Good evening. Tonight I want to examine the whole question of eighteenth-century social legislation - its relevance to the hierarchical structure of post-Renaissance society* and its impact on the future of parochial organization in an expanding agrarian economy. But first a bit of fun.
1122,John Cleese,To put England's social legislation in a European context is Professor Gert Van Der Whoops of the Rijksmuseum in the Hague.
1123,Michael Palin,Because ... Drake ... was ... too ... clever for... the German ... fleet.
1124,Michael Palin,... Oh I've forgotten what I said now.
1125,John Cleese,Well* I think cement is more interesting than people think.
1126,John Cleese,One subject... four different views ...
1127,John Cleese,twelve and six... in a plain wrapper.
1128,Michael Palin,It's...
1129,John Cleese,MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS'
1130,John Cleese,Uhm?
1131,John Cleese,What?
1132,John Cleese,Oh. Oh.
1133,John Cleese,Huh?
1134,John Cleese,Fine* fine. Fine.
1135,John Cleese,Must be a board meeting.
1136,John Cleese,Oh* no* that was Robertson.
1137,John Cleese,Robertson.
1138,John Cleese,That was Wilkins. He was a good* good* er* golfer* Wilkins.
1139,John Cleese,Bet you it won't.
1140,John Cleese,All right.
1141,John Cleese,You're on.
1142,John Cleese,Don't do it Parky.
1143,John Cleese,Come on now be sensible Parky.
1144,John Cleese,Johnson!
1145,Michael Palin,Good evening. Tonight 'Spectrum' looks at one of the major problems in the world today - that old vexed question of what is going on. Is there still time to confront it* let alone solve it* or is it too late? What are the figures* what are the facts* what do people mean when they talk about things? Alexander Hardacre of the Economic Affairs Bureau.
1146,Michael Palin,Telling figures indeed* but what do they mean to you* what do they mean to me* what do they mean to the average man in the street? With me now is Professor Tiddles of Leeds University...
1147,Michael Palin,... Professor* you've spent many years researching into things* what do you think?
1148,John Cleese,I think it's too early to tell.
1149,Michael Palin,Too early to tell' ... too early to say... it means the same thing. The word 'say' is the same as the word 'tell'. They're not spelt the same* but they mean the same. It's an identical situation* we have with 'ship' and 'boat'
1150,Michael Palin,But the real question remains. What is the solution* if any* to this problem? What can we do? What am I saying? Why am I sitting in this chair? Why am I on this programme? And what am I going to say next? Here to answer this is a professional cricketer.
1151,Michael Palin,Well* you were wrong... Professor?
1152,John Cleese,Hello.
1153,Michael Palin,Hello. So... where do we stand? Where do we stand? Where do we sit? Where do we come? Where do we go? What do we do? What do we say? What do we eat? What do we drink? What do we think? What do we do?
1154,John Cleese,Ach. Good time...good afternoon.
1155,John Cleese,Ja* ja. We haff a little...
1156,John Cleese,Was ist rückweise bewegen?
1157,Michael Palin,Hiking.
1158,John Cleese,Ah yes* ve make a little hike for* for Bideford.
1159,John Cleese,Ah! Hein...Reginald you have the wrong map here you silly old leg-before-wicket English person.
1160,Michael Palin,I'm sorry mein Fuhrer. I did not...
1161,Michael Palin,Mein Dickie old chum.
1162,John Cleese,Not much fun in Stalingrad* no.
1163,Michael Palin,How do you do there squire* also I am not Minehead lad but I in Peterborough* Lincolnshire was given birth to* but stay in Peterborough Lincolnshire house all during war* owing to nasty running sores* and was unable to go in the streets play football or go to Nürnberg. I am retired vindow cleaner and pacifist* without doing war crimes
1164,Michael Palin,tch tch tch* and am glad England win World Cup - Bobby Charlton* Martin Peters - and eating lots of chips and fish and hole in the toads* and Dundee cakes on Piccadilly line. Don't you know old chap I was head of Gestapo for ten years. Five years! No* no* nein* I was not head of Gestapo at all...I make joke.
1165,John Cleese,Get over there against the wall Britischer pig* you're going to die!
1166,Michael Palin,Take it easy Dickie old chum.
1167,John Cleese,Shut your cake hole you Nazi.
1168,Michael Palin,Ha* ha* ha.
1169,Michael Palin,The fun we have.
1170,John Cleese,If he opens his big mouth again...it's lampshade time!
1171,Michael Palin,Soon baby!
1172,John Cleese,I am not a racialist* but* und this is a big but* we in the National Bocialist Party believe das Überleben muss gestammen sein mit der schneaky Armstrong-Jones. Historische Taunton ist Volkermeinig von Meinhead.
1173,Michael Palin,* he says that historically Taunton is a part of Minehead already.
1174,John Cleese,Und Bridgwater ist die letzte Fühlung das wir haben in Somerset!
1175,John Cleese,What do you think of Mr Hilter's politics.
1176,John Cleese,Well* I think he'd do a lot of good to the Stock Exchange.
1177,Michael Palin,No...no...
1178,Michael Palin,Oh yes Britischer pals he is wunderbar...ful. So.
1179,Michael Palin,Foam at the mouth and fall over backwards. Is he foaming at the mouth to fall over backwards or falling over backwards to foam at the mouth. Tonight 'Spectrum' examines the whole question of frothing and falling* coughing and calling* screaming and bawling* walling and stalling* galling and mauling* palling and hauling* trawling and squalling and zalling. Zalling? Is there a word zalling? If there is what does it mean...if there isn't what does it mean? Perhaps both. Maybe neither. What do I mean by the word mean? What do I mean by the word word* what do I mean by what do I mean* what do I mean by do* and what do I do by mean? What do I do by do by do and what do I do by wasting your time like this? Goodnight.
1180,John Cleese,Goodnight.
1181,John Cleese,Speak up please* sir.
1182,John Cleese,I can't hear you* sir.
1183,John Cleese,That's a little bit too loud. Can you say it just a little less loud than that?
1184,John Cleese,No... I'm still not getting anything... Er* could you try it in a higher register?
1185,John Cleese,What?
1186,John Cleese,Ahl That's it* hang on a moment.
1187,John Cleese,Now a little bit louder.
1188,John Cleese,Report a what?
1189,John Cleese,That's the exact frequency... now keep it there.
1190,John Cleese,Evening Charlie.
1191,John Cleese,Well* I'm afraid I'm going off duty now sir. Er* could you tell First Sergeant Foster?
1192,John Cleese,Yes- I- can't- believe- it- I- thought- the- bloke- who'd- done- that- was- put- inside- last- year.
1193,John Cleese,Well it must have been somebody else.
1194,John Cleese,Some people do talk in the most extraordinary way.
1195,John Cleese,Good afternoon and welcome to Hurlingham Park. You join us just as the competitors are running out onto the field on this lovely winter's afternoon here* with the going firm underfoot and very little sign of rain. Well it certainly looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon's sport in this the 127th Upperclass Twit of the Year Show. Well the competitors will be off in a moment so let me just identify for you.
1196,John Cleese,And so the final result: The Upperclass Twit of the Year - Gervaise Brook-Hampster of Kensington and Weybridge; runner up - Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith of Kensington; and third - Nigel Incubator-Jones of Henley. Well there'll certainly be some car door slamming in the streets of Kensington tonight.
1197,Michael Palin,That's right ... yeah... yeah...
1198,Michael Palin,Shabby... Ken Shabby...
1199,Michael Palin,Oh yeah* yeah. I'll be able to look after 'er all right sport* eh* know what I mean* eh emggh!
1200,Michael Palin,I clean out public lavatories.
1201,Michael Palin,Oh yeah* yeah.
1202,Michael Palin,After five years they give me a brush... eurggha eurgh ... I'm sorry squire* I've gobbed on your carpet...
1203,Michael Palin,Well round at my gran's... she trains polecats* but most of them have suffocated so there should be a bit of spare room in the attic* eh. Know what I mean. Oooh!
1204,Michael Palin,Oh* right away sport. Right away... you know... I haven't had it for weeks...
1205,Michael Palin,Oh* diarrhoea.
1206,John Cleese,The story so far: Rosamund's father has become ensnared by Mr Shabby's extraordinary personal magnetism. Bob and Janet have eaten Mr Farquar's goldfish during an Oxfam lunch* and Mrs Elsmore's marriage is threatened by Doug's insistence that he is on a different level of consciousness. Louise's hernia has been confirmed* and Jim* Bob's brother* has run over the editor of the 'Lancet' on his way to see Jenny* a freelance Pagoda designer. On the other side of the continent Napoleon still broods over the smouldering remains of a city he had crossed half the earth to conquer...
1207,John Cleese,... whilst Mary* Roger's half-sister* settles down to watch television...
1208,John Cleese,There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Wood Party.
1209,John Cleese,Well* well Robert the main thing is that it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite clearly lodged between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little. Of course the main thing is we're getting colour pictures of an extraordinarily high quality. The important thing is* the really exciting thing is the minister will
1210,John Cleese,Oh* oh I needed that.
1211,Michael Palin,What do we mean by no* what do we mean by yes* what do we mean by no* no* no. Tonight Spectrum looks at the whole question of what is no.
1212,Michael Palin,It's...
1213,John Cleese,Er* please excuse my wife. She may appear to be rather nasty but underneath she has a heart of formica.
1214,John Cleese,I'm sorry about that.
1215,John Cleese,Oh I'm sorry.
1216,John Cleese,Please excuse my wife* she may not be very beautiful* and she may have no money* and she may be a little talentless* boring and dull* but on the other hand ...
1217,John Cleese,... sorry I can't think of anything.
1218,Michael Palin,Fine. I'm the head waiter. This is a vegetarian restaurant only* we serve no animal flesh of any kind. We're not only proud of that* we're smug about it. So if you were to come in here asking me to rip open a small defenseless chicken* so you could chew its skin and eat its intestines* then I'm afraid I'd have to ask you to leave.
1219,John Cleese,No* no* no* no.
1220,Michael Palin,Likewise if you were to ask us to slice the sides of a cow and serve it with small pieces of its liver ...
1221,Michael Palin,Not for food anyway.
1222,John Cleese,Sometimes Shirley I think you're almost human.
1223,Michael Palin,Do you know I still wet my bed?
1224,John Cleese,Once I married someone who was beautiful* and young* and gay* and free. Whatever happened to her?
1225,Michael Palin,I met my second wife at a second-wife-swapping party. Trust me to arrive late.
1226,Michael Palin,Hello Headmaster. What are you doing here?
1227,Michael Palin,No.
1228,Michael Palin,No it doesn't.
1229,Michael Palin,Fine. Would you care for a glass of blood? Oh what a giveaway.
1230,John Cleese,Perhaps you'd care for a drink?
1231,John Cleese,Good evening.
1232,John Cleese,I beg your pardon?
1233,John Cleese,Ah* oh how do you...
1234,John Cleese,Yes thank you.
1235,John Cleese,I don't know who keeps bringing them in here.
1236,John Cleese,Albatross! Albatross! Albatross!
1237,John Cleese,I haven't got choc-ices. I only got the albatross. Albatross!
1238,John Cleese,It's a bird* innit? It's a bloody sea bird . .. it's not any bloody flavour. Albatross!
1239,John Cleese,Course you don't get bloody wafers with it. Albatross!
1240,John Cleese,Ninepence.
1241,John Cleese,Gannet on a stick.
1242,Michael Palin,Inspector* inspector.
1243,John Cleese,Uh huh.
1244,Michael Palin,I'm terribly sorry but I was sitting on a park bench over there* took my coat off for a minute and then I found my wallet had been stolen and £15 taken from it.
1245,John Cleese,Well did you er* did you see anyone take it* anyone hanging around or...
1246,Michael Palin,No no* there was no one there at all. That's the trouble.
1247,John Cleese,Well there's not very much we can do about that* sir.
1248,Michael Palin,Do you want to come back to my place?
1249,John Cleese,... Yeah all right.
1250,John Cleese,Doctor Walters?
1251,John Cleese,No* doctor.
1252,John Cleese,You* doctor?
1253,Michael Palin,I would like to meet someone of superior intelligence.
1254,Michael Palin,I would like to see John the Babtist's impersonation of Graham Hill.
1255,John Cleese,Yes* it's Historical Impersonations. When you in the present can make those in the past stars of the future. And here is your host for tonight - Wally Wiggin.
1256,Michael Palin,Hello* good evening and welcome to Historical Impersonations. And we kick off tonight with Cardinal Richelieu and his impersonation of Petula Clark.
1257,Michael Palin,Don't sleep in the subway darling and don't stand in the pouring rain'.
1258,Michael Palin,Cardinal Richelieu - sixteen stone of pure man. And now your favourite Roman Emperor Julius Caesar as Eddie Waring.
1259,Michael Palin,Well done indeed* Julius Caesar* a smile* a conquest and a dagger up your strap. Our next challenger comes all the way from the Crimea. It's the very lovely Florence Nightingale as Brian London.
1260,Michael Palin,And now for our most ambitious attempt tonight - all the way from Moscow in the USS of R - Ivan the Terrible as a sales assistant in Freeman* Hardy and Willis.
1261,Michael Palin,And now W. G. Grace as a music box.
1262,Michael Palin,And now it's France's turn. One of their top statesmen* Napoleon as the R101 disaster.
1263,Michael Palin,And now it's request time.
1264,Michael Palin,I would like to see John the Baptist's impersonation of Graham Hill.
1265,Michael Palin,And now a short intermission during which Marcel Marceau will impersonate a man walking against the wind.
1266,Michael Palin,And now Marcel will mime a man being struck about the head by a sixteen-ton weight.
1267,John Cleese,What's your name?
1268,John Cleese,Would you like to have a sixteen-ton weight dropped on top of you* Eric?
1269,John Cleese,How about you?
1270,Michael Palin,I want to have.
1271,John Cleese,What do you want to have?
1272,Michael Palin,I want to have... I want to have Racquel Welch dropped on top of me.
1273,John Cleese,Dropped on top of you.
1274,Michael Palin,Oh yes* not climbing.
1275,John Cleese,And what's your name?
1276,John Cleese,And how old are you* Trevor?
1277,John Cleese,Are you a friend of Trevor's?
1278,Michael Palin,Yes* we're all colleagues from the Empire and General Insurance Company.
1279,John Cleese,And what do you do?
1280,Michael Palin,Well I deal mainly with mortgage protection policies* but I also do certain types of life assurance.
1281,John Cleese,Now if you and your pal had one big wish* Trevor* what would you like to see on television?
1282,Michael Palin,Yes* we in Special Crime Squad have been using wands for almost a year now. You find it's easy to make yourself invisible. You can defy time and space* and you can turn violent criminals into frogs. Something which you could never do with the old truncheons.
1283,John Cleese,Yes* tonight 'Probe Around' takes a look at crime...
1284,Michael Palin,Good evening.
1285,Michael Palin,That is correct.
1286,Michael Palin,The criminal mind is a strange and contorted one. Good evening. The mind is subject to severe mental stresses. Good evening. Guilt fears abound* good evening. In the subconscious in this state* one of our lads* with a fair training in the black arts can scare the fertilizer out of them.
1287,John Cleese,Up yours? What a rude Ouija board!
1288,John Cleese,Attila the Hun to see you* sir.
1289,John Cleese,Attila the Hun* sir.
1290,John Cleese,Over there* sir.
1291,Michael Palin,That's right* yes. A. T. Hun. My parents were Mr and Mrs Norman Hun* but they had a little joke when I was born.
1292,Michael Palin,Oh! Call me 'The'* for heaven's sake!
1293,Michael Palin,I've come to give myself up.
1294,Michael Palin,Looting* pillaging and sacking a major city.
1295,Michael Palin,Looting* pillaging* sacking a major city* and I'd like nine thousand other charges to be taken into consideration* please.
1296,Michael Palin,Oh* no. No* no* no* no.
1297,John Cleese,Here we are* sir.
1298,John Cleese,Well he breathes into it* sir* and the white crystals turn lime green. Then he is Attila the Hun* sir.
1299,Michael Palin,Right.
1300,John Cleese,He's Alexander the Great!
1301,Michael Palin,Oh curses! Curses! I thought I was safe* disguised as Attila the Hun.
1302,Michael Palin,Dear Sir* I object to being objected to by the last letter* before my drift has become apparent. I spent many years in India during the last war and am now a part-time notice board in a prominent public school. Yours etc.* Brigadier Zoe La Rue (deceased). PS Aghhh!
1303,John Cleese,Dear Sir* When I was at school* I was beaten regularly every thirty minutes* and it never did me any harm - except for psychological maladjusunent and blurred vision. Yours truly* Flight Lieutenant Ken Frankenstein (Mrs).
1304,John Cleese,Er* nurse!
1305,John Cleese,Er* you don't think you should make it clear that I'm a psychiatrist?
1306,John Cleese,Well* I could be any type of doctor.
1307,John Cleese,That's outside.
1308,John Cleese,Er* come in.
1309,John Cleese,Ah Mr Phelps. Come on in* take a seat. Now what seems to be the matter?
1310,John Cleese,I'm sorry?
1311,John Cleese,Well look will you please sit down and do your first line.
1312,John Cleese,I can't even get it started.
1313,John Cleese,Shut up! Oh it drives me mad.
1314,Michael Palin,A mad psychiatrist* that'd be new.
1315,John Cleese,Next please.
1316,John Cleese,Cross the threshold* arrive* ingress* gain admittance* infiltrate.
1317,John Cleese,Ah Mr Notlob* ah park your hips* on the sitting device.
1318,Michael Palin,It is a mad psychiatrist.
1319,John Cleese,I'm not. I'm not. Come on in. Take a seat. What's* what's the matter?
1320,John Cleese,Now what's the matter?
1321,Michael Palin,Well I keep hearing guitars playing and people singing when there's no one around.
1322,John Cleese,Yes* well this is not at all uncommon. In certain mental states we find that auditory hallucinations occur which are of a most ...
1323,John Cleese,Is that 'We're all going to the zoo tomorrow'?
1324,Michael Palin,Yes. Yes.
1325,John Cleese,Is it always that?
1326,Michael Palin,No.
1327,John Cleese,Well that's something.
1328,Michael Palin,But it's mainly folk songs.
1329,John Cleese,Oh my God.
1330,Michael Palin,Last night I had 'I'll never fall in love again' for six hours.
1331,John Cleese,Well look* I think I'd better have a second opinion on this. I want you to see a colleague of mine* a specialist in these sort of things* who has an office very much like this one as a matter of fact.
1332,Michael Palin,What?
1333,Michael Palin,What's going on? Who are they?
1334,Michael Palin,What are they doing in my stomach?
1335,Michael Palin,Of course they're not paying me rent!
1336,Michael Palin,Get them out!
1337,Michael Palin,Get them out.
1338,John Cleese,You are hereby ordered to vacate Mr Notlob forthwith. And or.
1339,John Cleese,Right* that's it* we're going in. Release the vicious dogs.
1340,John Cleese,When this series returns it will be put out on Monday mornings as a test card and will be described by 'Radio Times' as a history of Irish agriculture.
1341,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
1342,Michael Palin,It's...
1343,John Cleese,Hello Sailors! Listen* guess what. The Minister of Aviation has made me head of the RAF Ola Pola.
1344,John Cleese,So from now on we're going to do things my way. For a start David Hockney is going to design the bombs. And I've seen the plans...
1345,Michael Palin,Morning. Mrs G. Crump?
1346,Michael Palin,This is 46 Egernon Crescent?
1347,Michael Palin,Road* yes* says here. Yeah. Right* could I speak to Mrs G. Crump please?
1348,Michael Palin,Well it says 'Crump' here. Don't it* Harry?
1349,Michael Palin,Yeah* definitely Crump.
1350,Michael Palin,Well you can't have this. This is Crump.
1351,Michael Palin,Well I don't know. What we can do for you is take it back to the Depot* get a transfer slip from Crump to Pinnet* and put it on a special delivery.
1352,Michael Palin,What this? What leave it here?
1353,Michael Palin,Well I dunno. I suppose we could.
1354,Michael Palin,Yeah we could leave it on a temporary despatch note.
1355,Michael Palin,I know* it's ridiculous really* but there you are. Glad we could be of such a help. Right* would you sign it down there please* Mrs Crump?
1356,Michael Palin,Pinnet. Listen* just for the books make it a bit easier* could you sign it Crump-Pinnet.
1357,Michael Palin,Right. Thank you very much* dear. The cooker's yours. Right. Thank you very much* dear. Right.
1358,Michael Palin,Sorry about the bother... but there you are ... you know ... cheerio!
1359,Michael Palin,You what?
1360,Michael Palin,Oh we didn't realize you had an installation invoice.
1361,Michael Palin,No* we can't touch it without an MI* you see.
1362,John Cleese,If it's a special.
1363,Michael Palin,No* the special's the same as installation invoice.
1364,John Cleese,So it's an R16.
1365,Michael Palin,A pink form from Reading.
1366,Michael Palin,That's the one* love. Yeah* this should be all I need. Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs G. Pinnet.
1367,Michael Palin,Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice.
1368,Michael Palin,No* no* no - not an MI - no.
1369,John Cleese,What about London Office?
1370,Michael Palin,Well they haven't got the machinery.
1371,Michael Palin,Oh yeah* we could connect it up* love* but not unless it's an emergency.
1372,Michael Palin,No it's not. An emergency is 290... 'where there is actual or apparent loss of combustible gaseous substances'.
1373,John Cleese,No - that's valve adjustment.
1374,Michael Palin,No* quite. We'd have to turn it on.
1375,Michael Palin,No. But what we can do* and this is between you and me* I shouldn't really be telling you this* we'll turn your gas on* make a hole in your pipe* you ring Hounslow emergency* they'll be around here in a couple of days.
1376,Michael Palin,Oh well* in that case you'd have the South East Area Manager round here like a shot.
1377,Michael Palin,Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by fumes'* you'd have Head Office* Holbom* round here.
1378,Michael Palin,Yes. That's murder you see.
1379,Michael Palin,Oh - they'd do the lot for you* love.
1380,Michael Palin,... Well what is it now... 11:30... murder... they'll be round here by two.
1381,Michael Palin,Oh well* right love* if you'd like to lie down here.
1382,Michael Palin,Okay Harry.
1383,Michael Palin,Right* deep breaths love. Ring Head Office would you Norman...
1384,John Cleese,Times' please.
1385,John Cleese,Thank you.
1386,John Cleese,Good morning. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting* but I'm afraid my walk has become rather sillier recently* and so it takes me rather longer to get to work.
1387,John Cleese,Now then* what was it again?
1388,Michael Palin,Well sir* I have a silly walk and I'd like to obtain a Government grant to help me develop it.
1389,John Cleese,I see. May I see your silly walk?
1390,Michael Palin,Yes* certainly* yes.
1391,John Cleese,That's it* is it?
1392,Michael Palin,Yes* that's it* yes.
1393,John Cleese,It's not particularly silly* is it? I mean* the right leg isn't silly at all and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half turn every alternate step.
1394,Michael Palin,Yes* but I think that with Government backing I could make it very silly.
1395,John Cleese,Coffee?
1396,Michael Palin,Yes please.
1397,John Cleese,Now Mrs Two-Lumps* would you bring us in two coffees please?
1398,John Cleese,... Out of her mind. Now the Japanese have a man who can bend his leg back over his head and back again with every single step. While the Israelis... ah* here's the coffee.
1399,John Cleese,Thank you - lovely.
1400,John Cleese,You're really interested in silly walks* aren't you?
1401,Michael Palin,Oh rather. Yes.
1402,John Cleese,Well take a look at this* then.
1403,John Cleese,Now Mr Pudey. I'm not going to mince words with you. I'm going to offer you a Research Fellowship on the Anglo-French silly walk.
1404,Michael Palin,La Marche Futile?
1405,John Cleese,Bonjour ... et maintenant ... comme d'habitude* au sujet du Le Marché Commun. Et maintenant* je vous presente* encore une fois* mon ami* le pouf célèbre* Jean-Brian Zatapathique.
1406,Michael Palin,Merci* mon petit chou-chou Brian Trubshawe. Et maintenant avec les pieds à droite* et les pieds au gauche* et maintenant l'Anglais-Française Marche Futile* et voilà
1407,John Cleese,Good evening. On 'Ethel the Frog' tonight we look at violence. The violence of British Gangland. Last Tuesday a reign of terror was ended when the notorious Piranha brothers* Doug and Dinsdale
1408,John Cleese,an up-and-coming Eastend boxer. Doug was bornin February 1929 and Dinsdale two weeks later; and again a week after that. Their next door neighbour was Mrs April Simnel.
1409,Michael Palin,Kipling Road was a typical sort of Eastend street* people were in and out of each other's houses with each other's property all day. They were a cheery lot.
1410,Michael Palin,Oh ho......yes. Cheerful and violent. I remember Doug was very keen on boxing* until he learned to walk* then he took up putting the boot in the groin. Oh he was very interested in that. His mother had such trouble getting him to come in for his tea. He'd be out there putting his little boot in* you know* bless him. You know kids were very different then. They didn't have their heads filled with all this Cartesian dualism.
1411,John Cleese,At the age of fifteen Doug and Dinsdale started attending the Ernest Pythagoras Primary School in Clerkenwell.
1412,John Cleese,When the Piranhas left school they were called up but were found by an Army Board to be too unstable even for National Service. Denied the opportunity to use their talents in the service of their country* they began to operate what they called 'The Operation'. They would select a victim and then threaten to beat him up if he paid the so-called protection money. Four months later they started another operation which the called 'The Other Operation'. In this racket they selected another victim and threatened
1413,John Cleese,pay them. One month later they hit upon 'The Other Other Operation'. In this the victim was threatened that if he didn't pay them* they would beat him up. This for the Piranha brothers was the turning point.
1414,John Cleese,A small-time operator who fell foul of Dinsdale Piranha was Vince Snetterton-Lewis.
1415,John Cleese,Another man who had his head nailed to the floor was Stig O' Tracey.
1416,John Cleese,Clearly Dinsdale inspired tremendous loyalty and terror amongst his business associates* but what was he really like?
1417,John Cleese,I walked out with Dinsdale on many occasions and found him a most charming and erudite companion. He was wont to introduce one to eminent persons* celebrated American singers* members of the aristocracy and other gang leaders.
1418,John Cleese,Through his work for charity. He took a warm interest in Boys' Clubs* Sailors' Homes* Choristers' Associations* Scouting Jamborees and of course the Household Cavalry.
1419,John Cleese,I should say not. Dinsdale was a perfectly normal person in every way. Except is as much as he was convinced that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog whom he referred to as Spiny Norman.
1420,John Cleese,Normally he was wont to be about twelve feet from nose to tail* but when Dinsdale was
1421,John Cleese,depressed Norman could be anything up to eight hundred yards long. When Norman was about* Dinsdale would go very quiet and his nose would swell up and his teeth would start moving about and he'd become very violent and claim that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin. Dinsdale was a gentleman. And what's more he knew how to treat a female impersonator.
1422,John Cleese,Most of the strange tales concern Dinsdale* but what about Doug? One man who met him was Luigi Vercotti.
1423,Michael Palin,Well* I had been running a successful escort agency - high class* no really* high class girls - we didn't have any of that. That was right out. And I decided.
1424,Michael Palin,Anyway I decided then to open a high-class night club for the gentry at Biggleswade with International cuisine* cooking* top-line acts* and not a cheap clip joint for picking up tarts* that was right out* I deny that completely* and one night Dinsdale walked in with a couple of big lads* one of whom was carrying a tactical nuclear missile. They said I'd bought one of their fruit machines and would I pay for it.
1425,Michael Palin,Three quarters of a million pounds. Then they went out.
1426,Michael Palin,Well I had noticed that the lad with the thermo-nuclear device was the Chief Constable for the area. Anyway a week later they came back* said that the cheque had bounced and that I had to see Doug.
1427,Michael Palin,Doug
1428,Michael Palin,I was terrified of him. Everyone was terrified of Doug. I've seen grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug. Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.
1429,Michael Palin,He used sarcasm. He knew all the tricks* dramatic irony* metaphor* bathos* puns* parody* litotes and satire.
1430,John Cleese,By a combination of violence and sarcasm* the Piranha brothers by February 1966 controlled London and the South East. In February* though* Dinsdale made a big mistake.
1431,John Cleese,Latterly Dinsdale had become increasingly worried about Spiny Norman. He had come to the conclusion that Norman slept in an aeroplane hangar at Luton Airport.
1432,John Cleese,And so on February 22nd 1966* at Luton airport...
1433,John Cleese,Even the police began to sit up and take notice.
1434,John Cleese,"Sancho Panza (Mr Organs) spoilt an otherwise impeccably choreographed rape scene by his unscheduled appearance and persistent cries of \""What's all this then?\"".'"
1435,John Cleese,Well* that's all for now and so until next week...
1436,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
1437,Michael Palin,It's...
1438,Michael Palin,Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our chief weapon is surprise...surprise and fear...fear and surprise.... our two weapons are fear and surprise...and ruthless efficiency.... Our
1439,Michael Palin,Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as fear* surprise* ruthless efficiency* and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope* and nice red uniforms - oh damn!
1440,Michael Palin,I can't say it* you'll have to say it.
1441,Michael Palin,You'll have to say the bit about 'Our chief weapons are ...'
1442,Michael Palin,Expects.
1443,Michael Palin,Inquisition.
1444,Michael Palin,Our chief weapons are...
1445,Michael Palin,Surprise.
1446,Michael Palin,Stop. Stop there! Stop there. Whew! Our chief weapon is surprise* blah* blah* blah* blah. Cardinal* read the charges.
1447,Michael Palin,Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
1448,Michael Palin,Fear* surprise* and a most ruthless...
1449,Michael Palin,ooooh! Now* Cardinal* the rack!
1450,Michael Palin,You....Right! Tie her down.
1451,Michael Palin,Right! How do you plead?
1452,Michael Palin,Ha! Right! Cardinal* give the rack
1453,Michael Palin,give the rack a turn.
1454,Michael Palin,. I know you can't. I didn't want to say anything. I just wanted to try and ignore your crass mistake.
1455,Michael Palin,It makes it all seem so stupid.
1456,Michael Palin,Oh* go on* just pretend for God's sake.
1457,John Cleese,Ah* hello* you don't know me* but I'm from the BBC. We were wondering if you'd come and answer the door in a sketch over there* in that sort of direction... You wouldn't have to do anything - just open the door and that's it.
1458,John Cleese,Jolly good. Come this way.
1459,John Cleese,Yes* we're on film at the moment you see.
1460,John Cleese,Yes that's right* that sort of thing* yes* a link. It's all a bit zany - you know a bit madcap funster... frankly I don't fully understand it myself* the kids seem to like it. I much prefer Des O'Connor ... Rolf Harris ... Tom Jones* you know...
1461,John Cleese,Quite a lot yes* quite a lot. I'm mainly in comedy. I'd like to be in Programming Planning actually* but unfortunately I've got a degree.
1462,John Cleese,Punchline? I don't think there's a punchline scheduled* is there? Where are we? A week 39.4 no* it's Friday* isn't it - 39.7. Oh ... here we are. Oh!
1463,John Cleese,Ha* ha* ha* very good. Ha* ha* ha* very good. What a good punchline. Pity we missed that. Still* never mind* we can always do it again. Make a series out of it. Now if you'll just sign there* I'll put this through to our contracts department and you should be hearing from them in a year or two.
1464,John Cleese,Ah - can do. But won't. We were wondering if we could possibly borrow your head for a piece of animation.
1465,John Cleese,Oh jolly good. Thanks very much. You will get expenses.
1466,John Cleese,Gentlemen* our MP saw the PM this AM and the PM wants more LSD from the PIB by tomorrow AM or PM at the latest. I told the PM's PPS that AM was NBG so tomorrow PM it is for the PM nem. con. Give us a fag or I'll go spare. Now* the fiscal deficit with regard to the monetary balance* the current financial year excluding invisible exports* but adjusted of course for seasonal variations and the incremental statistics of the fiscal and revenue arrangements for the forthcoming annual budgetary period terminating in April.
1467,John Cleese,Bravo* Madge. Well done. Taxation is indeed the very nub of my gist. Gentlemen* we have to find something new to tax.
1468,John Cleese,Yes?
1469,John Cleese,What do you mean?
1470,John Cleese,Good Lord* you're not suggesting we should tax... thingy?
1471,John Cleese,Thingy!
1472,John Cleese,... Oh!
1473,Michael Palin,I would tax Racquel Welch. I've a feeling she'd tax me.
1474,John Cleese,Bring back hanging and go into rope.
1475,Michael Palin,I would cut off the more disreputable parts of the body and use the space for playing fields.
1476,Michael Palin,I would tax holiday snaps.
1477,Michael Palin,Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
1478,John Cleese,IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY* TO COMBAT THE RISING TIDE OF RELIGIOUS UNORTHODOXY* THE POPE GAVE CARDINAL XIMINEZ OF SPAIN LEAVE TO MOVE WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE THROUGHOUT THE LAND* IN A REIGN OF VIOLENCE* TERROR AND TORTURE THAT MAKES A SMASHING FILM. THIS WAS THE SPANISH INQUISITION...'
1479,Michael Palin,Now* old woman! You are accused of heresy on three counts. Heresy by thought* heresy by word* heresy by deed* and heresy by action.
1480,Michael Palin,counts. Do you confess?
1481,Michael Palin,Ha! Then we shall
1482,Michael Palin,you understand...Biggles! Fetch...the cushions!
1483,Michael Palin,Now* old lady* you have one last chance. Confess the heinous sin of heresy* reject the works of the ungodly -
1484,Michael Palin,last chances. You have three last chances* the nature of which I have divulged in my previous utterance.
1485,Michael Palin,Right! If that's the way you want it - Cardinal! Poke her with the soft cushions!
1486,Michael Palin,Confess! Confess! Confess!
1487,Michael Palin,Have you got all the stuffing up one end?
1488,Michael Palin,Hm! She is made of harder stuff! Cardinal Fang - fetch...the comfy chair!
1489,Michael Palin,So you think you are strong because you can survive the soft cushions. Well* we shall see. Biggles! Put her in the Comfy Chair!
1490,Michael Palin,Is that really all it is?
1491,Michael Palin,I see. I suppose we make it worse by shouting a lot* do we? Confess* woman. Confess! Confess!
1492,Michael Palin,Not you!
1493,Michael Palin,Who was that?
1494,Michael Palin,And now for the very first time on the silver screen comes the film from two books which once shocked a generation. From Emily Brontë's 'Wuthering Heights' and from the 'International Guide to Semaphore Code'. Twentieth Century Vole presents 'The Semaphore Version of Wuthering Heights'.
1495,Michael Palin,From the pulsating pages of history* from the dark and furious days of Imperial Rome we bring you a story that shattered the world! A tale so gripping that they said it could not he filmed. A unique event in cinema history! Julius Caesar on an Aldis lamp!
1496,Michael Palin,From the makers of 'Gunfight at the OK Corral in Morse Code'.
1497,Michael Palin,And the smoke-signal version of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'.
1498,Michael Palin,We have m'lud.
1499,John Cleese,Point?
1500,John Cleese,Cravat? Silk square?
1501,John Cleese,Brian Phelps.
1502,John Cleese,Fish.
1503,John Cleese,Fish wheeze. Fish wheeze?
1504,John Cleese,Fish breathe* throat.
1505,John Cleese,Drink.
1506,John Cleese,Four words.
1507,Michael Palin,First word shout?
1508,John Cleese,Bellow?
1509,John Cleese,Second word is very small.
1510,Michael Palin,A?
1511,John Cleese,An?
1512,Michael Palin,The?
1513,John Cleese,Gill?
1514,Michael Palin,Call the ... next!
1515,John Cleese,Hear. Can't hear.
1516,John Cleese,Bottom.
1517,Michael Palin,End! Call the next defend-.
1518,John Cleese,M'lud* and my other lud* the prosecution will endeavour to show m'lud* that m'lud - ah* not you m'lud* that m'lud* m'lud* while passing sentence at the Central Criminal Court blotted his copy book. Call exhibit Q.
1519,John Cleese,Sorry did I say Q? I meant A. Sorry* call exhibit A.
1520,John Cleese,Exhibit A m'lud* Miss Rita Thang* an artist's model* Swedish accordion teacher and cane-chair sales lady* was found guilty under the Rude Behaviour Act in the accused's court. The accused* m'lud* sentenced her to be taken from this place and brought round to his place.
1521,John Cleese,The accused then commented on Miss Thang's bodily structure* made several not-at-all legal remarks on the subject of fun and then placed his robes over his head and began to emit low moans.
1522,John Cleese,M'lud if we could continue ...
1523,Michael Palin,Two* er* three to the Old Bailey please.
1524,Michael Palin,Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
1525,Michael Palin,There's the lighting credit* only five left.
1526,Michael Palin,Hell* it's the producer - quick!
1527,Michael Palin,Nobody expects the Spa...
1528,Michael Palin,Oh bugger!
1529,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
1530,John Cleese,And now for something more completely different...
1531,Michael Palin,It's...
1532,Michael Palin,Oh Mr Belpit your legs are so swollen' ...
1533,Michael Palin,Oh Mr Belpit.* .'
1534,Michael Palin,Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show.
1535,Michael Palin,Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show. This is show five - I'm not in until show eight.
1536,Michael Palin,I'm just learning my lines* you know. 'Oh Mr Belpit* your legs...'
1537,Michael Palin,Yes* well. Try over there.
1538,Michael Palin,Oh Mr Belpit' - not at all - 'your legs are so swollen'.
1539,Michael Palin,Morning* luv.
1540,John Cleese,Anyway* this rather pointless bickering went on for some time until...
1541,John Cleese,This is the control cabin.
1542,John Cleese,Cloud's heavy ... What's the reading?
1543,John Cleese,No* not if it keeps at that level* no.
1544,John Cleese,Oh hello. Everything all right at the back?
1545,John Cleese,Dormice?
1546,Michael Palin,All right* don't anybody move ... except to control the aeroplane ... you can move a little to do that.
1547,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* yes. You can move a little bit. Yes. Sorry* I didn't mean to be so dogmatic when I came in. Obviously you can all move a little within reason. There are certain involuntary muscular movements which no amount of self-control can prevent. And obviously any assertion of authority on my part* I've got to take that into account.
1548,John Cleese,Right. I mean one couldn't for example* stop one's insides from moving.
1549,Michael Palin,No* no. Good point* good point.
1550,John Cleese,And the very fact that the plane is continuously vibrating means that we're all moving to a certain extent.
1551,Michael Palin,And we're all moving our lips* aren't we?
1552,John Cleese,Absolutely.
1553,Michael Palin,No* the gist of my meaning was that sudden... er...
1554,Michael Palin,Exaggerated
1555,Michael Palin,movements... are... are out.
1556,John Cleese,Well* that's the great thing about these modern airliners. I mean* I can keep this plane flying with only the smallest movement and Pancho here doesn't have to move at all.
1557,Michael Palin,Oh* that's marvellous.
1558,Michael Palin,Well that's wonderful ... 60% success* eh?
1559,Michael Palin,Anyway* bearing all that in mind* will you fly this plane to Luton* please?
1560,John Cleese,Well* this is a scheduled flight to Cuba.
1561,Michael Palin,I know* I know* that's rather why I came in here with that point about nobody moving.
1562,Michael Palin,Within reason - yes. I... er ... er... you know* I want you to fly this plane to Luton ... please.
1563,John Cleese,Right* well I'd better turn the plane round then. Stand by emergency systems.
1564,Michael Palin,Look I don't want to cause any trouble.*
1565,John Cleese,No* no* we'll manage* we'll manage.
1566,Michael Palin,I mean* near Luton will do* you know. Harpenden* do you go near Harpenden?
1567,Michael Palin,Okay* well* drop me off there. I'll get a bus to Luton. It's only twenty-five minutes.
1568,Michael Palin,Oh* well that's smashing.
1569,Michael Palin,Oh well* look* forget it. Forget it. I'll come to Cuba* and get a flight back to Luton from there.
1570,John Cleese,Well* we could lend you a parachute.
1571,Michael Palin,No* no* no* no* no. I wouldn't dream of it... wouldn't dream of it... dirtying a nice* clean parachute.
1572,Michael Palin,Well* if it's all right.
1573,Michael Palin,Not any trouble?
1574,Michael Palin,That's marvellous. Thank you very much. Sorry to come barging in.
1575,Michael Palin,Thank you. Bye.
1576,Michael Palin,Thank you!
1577,John Cleese,Take this bus to Cuba.
1578,John Cleese,From these glens and scars* the sound of the coot and the moorhen is seldom absent. Nature sits in stern mastery over these rocks and crags. The rush of the mountain stream* the bleat of the sheep* and the broad* clear Highland skies* reflected in turn and loch ...
1579,John Cleese,... form the breathtaking backdrop against which Ewan McTeagle writes such poems as 'Lend us a quid till the end of the week'.
1580,John Cleese,But it was with more simple* homespun verses that McTeagle's unique style first flowered.
1581,John Cleese,One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young friend - Lassie O'Shen.
1582,John Cleese,Since then* McTeagle has developed and widened his literary scope. Three years ago he concerned himself with quite small sums - quick bits of ready cash: sixpences* shillings* but more recently he has turned his extraordinary literary perception to much larger sums - fifteen shillings* £4.12.6 ... even nine guineas ... But there is still nothing to match the huge sweep ... the majestic power of what is surely his greatest work: 'Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed?'.
1583,John Cleese,There seems to be no end to McTeagle's poetic invention. 'My new cheque book hasn't arrived' was followed up by the brilliantly allegorical 'What's twenty quid to the bloody Midland Bank?' and more recently his prizewinning poem to the Arts Council: 'Can you lend me one thousand quid?'
1584,Michael Palin,I think what McTeagle's pottery... er... poetry is doing is
1585,Michael Palin,all the traditional cliches of modern pottery. No longer do we have to be content with Keats's 'Seasons of mists and mellow fruitfulness'* Wordsworth's 'I wandered lonely as a cloud' and Milton's 'Can you lend us two bob till Tuesday'...
1586,John Cleese,As a Highlander I would like to complain about some inaccuracies in the preceding film about the poet Ewan McTeagle. Although his name was quite clearly given as McTeagle* he was throughout wearing the Cameron tartan. Also I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman who complained about aeronautical inaccuracies was himself wearing a captain's hat* whereas he only had lieutenant's stripes on the sleeves of his jacket. Also* in the Inverness pantomime last Christmas* the part of Puss in Boots was played by a native of New Guinea with a plate in her lip* so that every time Dick Whittington gave her a French kiss* he got the back of his throat scraped.
1587,Michael Palin,Look* would you mind going away* I'm trying to examine this man.
1588,Michael Palin,a doctor. Actually* I'm a gynaecologist... but this is my lunchhour.
1589,Michael Palin,Ah* good morning. I'm afraid our regular psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning ... and I've got an ego block which is in turn making my wife over-assertive and getting us both into a state of depressive neurosis.
1590,Michael Palin,Jersey Cream Psychiatrists.
1591,Michael Palin,I'm a doctor.
1592,Michael Palin,Yes* but I
1593,Michael Palin,a doctor. Actually* I'm a gynaecologist but that was my lunchhour.
1594,Michael Palin,Two pints of cream.
1595,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* I see. And a pot of yogurt* please.
1596,John Cleese,I feel the time has come to complain about people who make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints are justified.
1597,John Cleese,Not necessarily* however* I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.
1598,John Cleese,Sorry.
1599,Michael Palin,I'd like to complain about people who hold things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time something was done about it.
1600,Michael Palin,Jeez* Mr Belpit your legs is all swollen'...
1601,Michael Palin,Good evening. Tonight on 'It's the Mind'* we examine the phenomenon of déjà vu. That strange feeling we sometimes get that we've lived through something before* that what is happening now has already happened. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of déjà vu* that strange feeling we sometimes get that we've ...
1602,Michael Palin,Anyway* tonight on 'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of déjà vu* that strange...
1603,Michael Palin,Good evening. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of déjà vu* that strange feeling we someti... mes get ... that ... we've lived through something...
1604,Michael Palin,Good ... good evening. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of dddddddddddéjà vvvvvvvvuu* that extraordinary feeling... quite extraordinary...
1605,Michael Palin,Look* something's happening to me. I - I - um* I think I'd better go and see someone. Goodnight.
1606,Michael Palin,No* doctor* no. Something very funny's happening to me.
1607,Michael Palin,Oh* Mr Belpit* your legs are so swollen.'
1608,Michael Palin,I have this terrible feeling of déjà vu.
1609,Michael Palin,I have this terrible feeling of déjà vu..
1610,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
1611,Michael Palin,It's...
1612,John Cleese,THE BBC WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE NEXT ANNOUNCEMENT'
1613,John Cleese,Good morning* gentlemen. This is a twelwe-storey block combining classical neo-Georgian features with the efficiency of modern techniques. The tenants arrive in the entrance hall here* and are carried along the corridor on a conveyor belt in extreme comfort and past murals depicting Mediterranean scenes* towards the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor are heavily soundproofed. The blood pours down these chutes and the mangled flesh slurps into these...
1614,Michael Palin,Excuse me....
1615,John Cleese,Hm?
1616,Michael Palin,Did you say knives?
1617,John Cleese,Rotating knives* yes.
1618,John Cleese,Does that not fit in with your plans?
1619,Michael Palin,No* it does not. We asked for a simple block of flats.
1620,John Cleese,Oh* I see. I hadn't correctly divined your attitude towards your tenants. You see I mainly design slaughter houses. Yes* pity. Mind you* this is a real beaut. I mean* none of your blood caked on the walls and flesh flying out of the windows* inconveniencing the passers-by with this one. I mean* my life has been building up to this.
1621,John Cleese,May I ask you to reconsider. I mean* you wouldn't regret it. Think of the tourist trade.
1622,Michael Palin,No* no* it's just that we wanted a block of flats* not an abattoir.
1623,John Cleese,Yes* well* of course* this is just the sort blinkered philistine pig ignorance I've come to expect from you non-creative garbage. You sit there on your loathsome* spotty behinds squeezing blackheads* not caring a tinker's cuss about the struggling artist.
1624,John Cleese,You excrement! You lousy hypocritical whining toadies with your lousy colour TV sets and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs and your bleeding masonic handshakes! You wouldn't let me join* would you* you blackballing bastards. Well I wouldn't become a freemason now if you went down on your lousy* stinking* purulent knees and begged me.
1625,John Cleese,Oh
1626,John Cleese,the abattoir* that's not important. But if any of you could put in a word for me I'd love to be a freemason. Freemasonry opens doors. I mean* I was...I was a bit on edge just now* but if I were a mason I'd sit at the back and not get in anyone's way.
1627,Michael Palin,Thank you.
1628,John Cleese,I've got a second-hand apron.
1629,John Cleese,I nearly got in at Hendon.
1630,Michael Palin,I quite agree. I mean* providing the tenants are of light build and relatively sedentary and er* given a spot of good weather* I think we're on to a winner here.
1631,John Cleese,It opens doors* I'm telling you.
1632,John Cleese,Having once identified a mason immediate steps must be taken to isolate him from the general public. Having accomplished that it is now possible to cure him of these unfortunate masonic tendencies through the use of behavioural psychotherapy.
1633,John Cleese,In this treatment the patient is rewarded for the correct response and punished for the wrong one. Let us begin. Would you like to give up being a mason? Think carefully. Think. Think.
1634,John Cleese,The BBC would like to apologize for the following announcement.
1635,Michael Palin,What do you want?
1636,Michael Palin,What was that?
1637,Michael Palin,Oh* oh* yes...yeah well* unfortunately* guv* that offer's no longer valid. You see* it turned out not to be commercially viable* so we now have a totally new offer...
1638,Michael Palin,A nude lady.
1639,Michael Palin,Yes. You get a nude lady with a fully comprehensive motor insurance. If you just want third party she has to keep her bra on* and if it's just theft...
1640,Michael Palin,Devious.
1641,Michael Palin,Aston Martin?
1642,Michael Palin,Five hundred quid.
1643,Michael Palin,Forty quid.
1644,Michael Palin,Forty quid and a nude lady.
1645,Michael Palin,Dirty books?
1646,Michael Palin,Who's there
1647,Michael Palin,The Reverend who?
1648,Michael Palin,Oh* come in.
1649,Michael Palin,Now then* vic. What's the trouble?
1650,Michael Palin,I don't know* mush* I'll have to look in the script...
1651,Michael Palin,Where are we? Show 8. Are you 'man?
1652,Michael Palin,No...no* you're finished.
1653,Michael Palin,The vicar sits'.
1654,Michael Palin,Oh* yeah* yeah - well* you see* it's just that we're not...as yet...
1655,Michael Palin,satisfied with the grounds of your claim.
1656,Michael Palin,Oh well* that's just insurance jargon* you know.
1657,Michael Palin,...here we are. It states quite clearly that no claim you make will be paid.
1658,Michael Palin,You see* you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' policy* which* you know* if you never claim is very worthwhile...but you had to claim* and* well* there it is.
1659,Michael Palin,Still* never mind - could be worse. How's the nude lady?
1660,Michael Palin,Look...Rev...I hate to see a man cry* so shove off out the office* there's a good chap.
1661,Michael Palin,The bishop!
1662,John Cleese,And it is for this reason that the Christian Church lays upon you* the godparents* the obligation of seeing this child is brought up in the Christian faith. Therefore* I name this child...
1663,John Cleese,Francesco Luigi...
1664,Michael Palin,This is where we came in.
1665,Michael Palin,Builders haven't been then.
1666,Michael Palin,Well* at least the poet's been installed* then.
1667,John Cleese,Yes* a poet is essential for complete home comfort* and all-year round reliability at low cost. We in the East Midlands Poet Board hope to have a poet in every home by the end of next year.
1668,Michael Palin,Morning* madam* I've come to read your poet.
1669,Michael Palin,What is it* a Swinburne? Shelley?
1670,Michael Palin,Oh* bloody daffodils.
1671,Michael Palin,Right. Thank you* madam.
1672,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* the weather situation is generally favourable. There's a ridge of high pressure centred over Ireland which is moving steadily eastward bringing cloudy weather to parts of the West Country* Wales and areas west of the Pennines. On tomorrow's chart ...
1673,Michael Palin,the picture is much the same. With this occluded front bringing drier* warmer weather. Temperatures about average for the time of year. That's three degrees centigrade* forty-four degrees fahrenheit* so don't forget to wrap up well. That's all from me. Goodnight.
1674,Michael Palin,Well* it's a living* isn't it?
1675,Michael Palin,Well* you know* sometimes ... yeah. Anyway* I think I'd better be going.
1676,Michael Palin,Er* yeah* yeah* it er... it er ... it goes on and off.
1677,Michael Palin,Er ... um... well* I'll have a look at the batteries.
1678,Michael Palin,It's four and a half volts.
1679,Michael Palin,No* no* I must be off* really.
1680,Michael Palin,Ah well* I can't touch him. He's a novelist.
1681,Michael Palin,Oh well* novelists do* you see.
1682,Michael Palin,Harness.
1683,Michael Palin,Wombat.
1684,Michael Palin,All right* I'll have a quick look at yer Thomas Hardy.
1685,John Cleese,Nude man* what did you make of that?
1686,John Cleese,Bishop.
1687,John Cleese,Catch.
1688,Michael Palin,These are the words that are not to be used again on this programme.
1689,Michael Palin,Out!
1690,John Cleese,Right* who's got a boil on his Semprini* then?
1691,Michael Palin,Good morning* sir. Can I help you?
1692,Michael Palin,Ah. A toilet requisite-t-t-t-t-t... Would you like to try this* sir. It's our very very latest* it's called Sea Mist.
1693,Michael Palin,How about something a little more musky? This one's called Mimmo.
1694,Michael Palin,Fishier?
1695,Michael Palin,Fish* fish* fish. A fishy requisite-t-t-t-t-t...
1696,Michael Palin,Or bream?
1697,Michael Palin,No* we haven't got any of that... ah* I've got mackerel... or cod... or hake...
1698,Michael Palin,Er... parrot? What's that doing there? Or skate with just a hint of prawn? Or crab* tiger and almonds* very unusual.
1699,Michael Palin,Well* sir* we had a fishy consignment in this morning* so I could nip down to the basement and see if I can come up trumps on this particular requisite-t-t-t-t-t. So it was halibut... or... ?
1700,Michael Palin,Sea bass. Won't be a moment.
1701,Michael Palin,Well* sorry* sir.
1702,Michael Palin,Well* I'm afraid it didn't come in this morning* sir. But we have got some down at our Kensington branch. I'll just nip down there and get it for you.
1703,Michael Palin,Twenty minutes.
1704,Michael Palin,I use a body rub called Halitosis to make my breath seem sweet.
1705,John Cleese,I use an aftershave called Semprini.
1706,Michael Palin,I'm sorry* sorry - can't stop now* I've got to get to Kensington.
1707,Michael Palin,I use two kinds of aftershave lotions - Frankincense* Myrrh -
1708,Michael Palin,kinds of aftershave lotion. Frankincense* ....
1709,Michael Palin,I use Rancid Polecat number two. It keeps my skin nice and scaly.
1710,Michael Palin,Sorry again. Can't stop - got to get back.
1711,Michael Palin,Well I'm afraid they don't have any at our Kensington branch. But we have some down at the depot.
1712,Michael Palin,Aberdeen.
1713,Michael Palin,It's all right. Wait here ... I've got a car.
1714,Michael Palin,Almond requisite... t... t... ?
1715,Michael Palin,Aren't you going to say 'What's all this then?'?
1716,Michael Palin,This man has been shoplifting* officer.
1717,Michael Palin,Yes.
1718,Michael Palin,No* but he's been shoplifting.
1719,Michael Palin,Officer* it wasn't him.
1720,Michael Palin,He's the shoplifter.
1721,Michael Palin,Heresy. Blimey. I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.
1722,John Cleese,The BBC would like to apologize to the police about the character of Police Constable Pan Am. He was not meant to represent the average police officer. Similarly* the reference to Buzz Aldrin* the astronaut* was the product of a disordered mind and should not be construed as having any other significance.
1723,Michael Palin,Monty Python's Flying Circus tonight comes to you live from the Grillomat Snack Bar* Paignton.
1724,John Cleese,Hello to you live from the Grillomat Snack Bar* Paignton. And so* without any more ado* let's have the titles.
1725,Michael Palin,It's...
1726,John Cleese,Well* those were the titles. And now for the first item this evening on the Menu - ha ha - the team have chosen as a little hors d'oeuvres an item - and I think we can be sure it won't be an ordinary item - in fact the team told me just before the show that anything could happen* and probably would - so let's have ... the item.
1727,Michael Palin,Hello* good evening* and welcome to 'Blackmail'! And to start tonight's programme* we go to Preston in Lancashire* and Mrs Betty Teal!
1728,Michael Palin,Hello* Mrs Teal!
1729,Michael Palin,Now this is for £15 and it's to stop us revealing the name of your lover in Bolton.
1730,Michael Palin,So Mrs Teal...if you send us £15 by return post* please* and your husband Trevor* and your lovely children* Diane* Janice and Juliet need never know the name of your lover in Bolton.
1731,Michael Palin,...to stop us from revealing your name* the name of the three other people involved* the youth organization to which they belong* and the shop where you bought the equipment.
1732,Michael Palin,We'll be showing you more of that photograph later in the programme...unless we hear from Charles or Michael. And now it's time for our 'Stop the Film' spot!
1733,Michael Palin,The rules are very simple. We have taken a film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant details* which could wreck a man's career. But* the victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But remember the money increases as the film goes on. So the longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So now* with the clock at £300 this week 'Stop the Film' visited Thames Ditton...
1734,Michael Palin,He's being very brave here...
1735,Michael Palin,Hello* sir* hello* yes. No sir* no* I'm sure you didn't. No* it's all right* sir* we don't morally censure* we just want the money....Yes* and here's the address to send it to:
1736,Michael Palin,Not at all* sir...thank
1737,John Cleese,Er* Cutler* Staffordshire. Um ... well* Mr Chairman* it's just that most of the members in Staffordshire feel... the whole thing's a bit silly.
1738,Michael Palin,Good thinking* sir. I'll get the horse.
1739,John Cleese,All right* Medwin* let's see you get over that horse. Pick your feet up* Medwin. Come on* boy!
1740,John Cleese,Colonel! I've just found another exit* sir.
1741,John Cleese,Ah* hello. Well they certainly seem to be in a tight spot* and
1742,John Cleese,spot... our next item - so let's get straight on with the fun and go over to the next item - or dish! Ha* ha!
1743,John Cleese,Hello. 'Ow are you? I'm fine. Welcome to a new half-hour chat show in which me* viz the man what's talking to you now* and Brooky - to wit my flat mate - and nothing else* I'd like to emphasize that - discuss current affairs issues of burning import.
1744,John Cleese,Shut up. Tonight* the population explosion.
1745,John Cleese,Shut up. Come the year 1991* given the present rate of increase in the world's population* the Chinese will be three deep. Another thing...
1746,John Cleese,Lord Hill's at the bottom of this.
1747,John Cleese,I wouldn't wipe me nose on it.
1748,John Cleese,Shh. I can hear something. 'Ang about* we may still get in this show as a link.
1749,John Cleese,Colour separation* you cotton head.
1750,John Cleese,Well* they seem to be in another tight spot...
1751,John Cleese,Well and now we move on to our* to our main course. Prawn salad...Prawn salad?
1752,Michael Palin,Right* sir.
1753,Michael Palin,That's right* sir. Would you come this way* please.
1754,Michael Palin,Oh* Mr Belpit. Your legs are so swollen.
1755,Michael Palin,Um* I'm sorry* I don't know. I'm not in this one - I'm in next week's* I think.
1756,Michael Palin,Oh* Mr Belpit!...
1757,John Cleese,Ah well* they seem to have linked that themselves* so there's no need for me to interrupt at all. So* ah* back to the school hall.
1758,Michael Palin,Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'.
1759,Michael Palin,Sorry* I'm late* Headmaster - I've been wrestling with Plato.
1760,Michael Palin,Right* do you four boys take these two girls to be your seven brides?
1761,Michael Palin,Right* go and do your prep.
1762,Michael Palin,Good morning* I'd care to purchase a chicken* please.
1763,Michael Palin,I beg your pardon?
1764,Michael Palin,Thank you. And how much does that work out to per pound* my good fellow?
1765,Michael Palin,I'm sorry?
1766,Michael Palin,I see* and I'd care to purchase some stuffing in addition* please.
1767,Michael Palin,What?
1768,Michael Palin,Oh* thank you.
1769,Michael Palin,Excuse me.
1770,Michael Palin,Well* I can't help noticing that you insult me and then you're polite to me alternately.
1771,Michael Palin,That's all right. It doesn't really matter.
1772,John Cleese,Sorry* I asked for tea.
1773,John Cleese,Now I did ask for tea.
1774,John Cleese,No* no* that was just my announcement* just a metaphor.
1775,John Cleese,We come...look would you mind keeping it down* please...we come as - as I said just now* to the coffee.
1776,John Cleese,Shut up!
1777,Michael Palin,This is Ken Clean-Air Systems* the great white hope of the British boxing world. After three fights - and only two convictions - his manager believes that Ken is now ready to face the giant American* Satellite Five.
1778,Michael Palin,Every morning* he jogs the forty-seven miles from his two-bedroomed* eight-bathroom* six-up-two-down* three-to-go-house in Reigate* to the Government's Pesticide Research Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why.
1779,Michael Palin,Every morning at his little three-room semi near Reading* Ken gets up at three o'dock
1780,Michael Palin,and goes back to bed again because it's far too early.
1781,Michael Palin,At seven o'clock Ken gets up* he has a quick shower* a rub-down* gets into his track-suit* and goes back to bed again.
1782,Michael Palin,At 7.50 every morning Ken's trainer runs the 13*000 miles from his two-room lean-to in Bangkok and gets him up.
1783,Michael Palin,I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet.
1784,Michael Palin,For breakfast every day* Ken places a plate of liver and bacon under his chair* and locks himself in the cupboard.
1785,Michael Palin,At 8.30 the real training begins.
1786,Michael Palin,At 10.30 every morning Ken arrives at what he thinks is the gym. Sometimes it's a sweetshop* sometimes it's a private house. Today its a hospital.
1787,Michael Palin,For lunch Ken crouches down in the road and rubs gravel into his hair.
1788,Michael Palin,Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like this one* the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off.
1789,Michael Palin,What is he like in the ring* this human dynamo* this eighteen-stone bantam weight battering-ram? We asked his sparring partner and one-time childhood sweetheart* Maureen Spencer.
1790,Michael Palin,Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight is Petula Wilcox* the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist before turning pro in 1968.
1791,Michael Palin,She's keen on knitting and likes Cliff Richard records. How does she rate her chances against Ken?
1792,Michael Palin,My lords* ladies and gedderbong... On my right* from the town of Reigate in the county of Kent* the heavyweight...
1793,Michael Palin,and on my left! Miss Petula Wilcox.
1794,John Cleese,I think boxing's a splendid sport - teaches you self-defense.
1795,John Cleese,Oh* er* there you are. Hello. You got the note* jolly good. Well* um* that's all the items that we have for you this week and er* what a jolly nice lot of items too* eh? Um...well* the same team will be back with you again next week with another menu full of items. Um...I don't know if I shall be introducing the show next week as I understand my bits in this show have not been recieved quite as well as they might
1796,John Cleese,Sorry. I do beg your pardon. I don't like these...displays of emotion...I wish it would say the end.
1797,Michael Palin,Well* it's five past nine and nearly time for six past nine. On BBC 2 now it'll shortly be six and a half minutes past nine. Later on this evening it'll be ten o'clock and at 10.30 we'll be joining BBC 2 in time for 10.33* and don't forget tomorrow when it'll be 9.20. Those of you who missed 8.45 on Friday will be able to see it again this Friday at a quarter to nine. Now here is a time check. It's six and a half minutes to the big green thing.
1798,Michael Palin,I get so bored. I get so bloody bored.
1799,John Cleese,You probably noticed that I didn't say 'and now for something completely different' just now. This is simply because I am unable to appear in the show this week.
1800,John Cleese,Sorry to interrupt you.
1801,Michael Palin,My Lord Mayor* Lady Mayoress* it gives me very great pleasure to return to my old school* to present the prizes in this centenary year. This school takes very justifiable pride in its fine record of... aaaaagh!
1802,Michael Palin,... scholarship and sporting achievement in all... aaaagh!
1803,John Cleese,Oh... bad luck! The next prize...
1804,Michael Palin,Who shall declare this good* that ill
1805,Michael Palin,Absolutely wonderful.
1806,Michael Palin,No* darling* you tell them.
1807,Michael Palin,Excuse me a moment.
1808,John Cleese,Dung* sir.
1809,Michael Palin,What?
1810,John Cleese,We've got your dung.
1811,Michael Palin,What dung?
1812,John Cleese,Your dung. Three hundredweight of heavy droppings. Where do you want it?
1813,Michael Palin,I didn't order any dung.
1814,John Cleese,Yes you did* sir. You ordered it through the Book of the Month Club.
1815,Michael Palin,Book of the Month Club?
1816,John Cleese,That's right* sir. You get 'Gone with the Wind'* 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo* 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' and with every third book you get dung.
1817,Michael Palin,I didn't know that when I signed the form.
1818,John Cleese,Well* no* no. It wasn't on the form - they found it wasn't good for business. Anyway* we've got three hundredweight of dung in the van. Where do you want it?
1819,Michael Palin,Well* I don't think we do. We've no garden.
1820,John Cleese,Well* it'll all fit in here - it's top-class excrement.
1821,Michael Palin,You can't put it in here* we've having a dinner party!
1822,John Cleese,Salright. I'll put it on the telly.
1823,Michael Palin,Darling... there's a man here with our Book of the Month Club dung.
1824,John Cleese,Well* how many rooms have you got* then?
1825,Michael Palin,Well* there's only this room* the bedroom* a spare room.
1826,John Cleese,Oh well* I'll tell you what* move everything into the main bedroom* then you can use the spare room as a dung room.
1827,Michael Palin,Yes.
1828,Michael Palin,What?
1829,Michael Palin,I didn't see that in the adverts...
1830,Michael Palin,We've no room.
1831,John Cleese,That's all right - you can put the dead Indian in the spare room on top of the dung.
1832,Michael Palin,He's not dead!
1833,John Cleese,Have you* er... you read and enjoyed 'The French Lieutenant's Woman'* then?
1834,Michael Palin,No.
1835,John Cleese,No... still* it's worth it for the dung* isn't it?
1836,Michael Palin,And that's not all. Three fabulous new prizes have just been added* a four-month supply of interesting undergarments
1837,Michael Palin,* and a hand-painted scene of Arabian splendour* complete with silly walk.
1838,John Cleese,Yes* we met in the Turkish bath yesterday.
1839,John Cleese,Great* great* great.
1840,John Cleese,Yes* I did.
1841,Michael Palin,Oh* Mr Willimas* it's so nice to see you. Will you sign this for my little daughter* please?
1842,Michael Palin,Yes* sir.
1843,John Cleese,Timmy Williams' 'Coffee Time' was brought to you live from Woppi's in Holborn.
1844,Michael Palin,Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight one of the country's leading skin specialists - Raymond Luxury Yacht.
1845,Michael Palin,I'm sorry - Raymond Luxury
1846,Michael Palin,.
1847,Michael Palin,You're a very silly man and I'm not going to interview you.
1848,Michael Palin,Not at all. It's not even a proper nose.
1849,Michael Palin,It's polystyrene.
1850,Michael Palin,You can collect it at reception. Now go away.
1851,Michael Palin,Well you can't.
1852,Michael Palin,Good morning. I want to get married.
1853,Michael Palin,Well* can I get married
1854,Michael Palin,him?
1855,John Cleese,Come on* Henry.
1856,Michael Palin,Will
1857,Michael Palin,marry me?
1858,John Cleese,I'm already married.
1859,John Cleese,. Anyway* let's go straight over to James Gilbert at Leicester.
1860,Michael Palin,Well it's a straight fight here at Leicester...On the left of the Returning Officer
1861,Michael Palin,and on the other side is the silly candidate Jethro Walrustitty with his agent and his wife.
1862,Michael Palin,Sensible Party
1863,Michael Palin,Silly Party
1864,John Cleese,Well* there's the first result and the Silly Party has held Leicester. What do you make of that* Norman?
1865,Michael Palin,Well* this is largely as I predicted* except that the Silly Party won. I think this is largely due to the number of votes cast. Gerald?
1866,John Cleese,No* no we haven't time* because we're just going straight over to Luton.
1867,Michael Palin,Here at Luton it's a three-cornered fight between Alan Jones - Sensible Party* in the middle* Tarquin Fin- tim- lim- bim- whin- bim- lim- bus- stop- F'tang- F'tang- Olè- Biscuitbarrel - Silly Party* and Kevin Phillips-Bong* the Slightly Silly candidate.
1868,Michael Palin,On the left* Sensible Party
1869,Michael Palin,On the right* Slightly Silly.
1870,Michael Palin,Silly.
1871,Michael Palin,And so the Silly Party has taken Luton.
1872,John Cleese,A gain for the Silly Party at Luton. The first gain of the election* Norman?
1873,Michael Palin,Well this is a highly significant result. Luton* normally a very sensible constituency with a high proportion of people who aren't a bit silly* has gone completely ga-ga.
1874,John Cleese,Do we have the swing at Luton?
1875,John Cleese,Er* well* ah* there...there
1876,John Cleese,the swing* how about a swong?
1877,Michael Palin,Well* I've got the swong here in this box and it's looking fine. I can see through the breathing holes that it's eating up peanuts at the rate of knots.
1878,John Cleese,And how about the swang?
1879,John Cleese,What do you make of the nylon dot cardigan and plastic mule rest?
1880,John Cleese,Thank you* Spike.
1881,Michael Palin,Can I just come in here and say that the swong has choked itself to death.
1882,John Cleese,I'm sorry* Sasha* we're just about to get another result.
1883,John Cleese,Mrs Elsie Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
1884,John Cleese,26*317... James Walker...
1885,John Cleese,26*318.00
1886,John Cleese,Malcolm Peter Brian Telescope Adrian Umbrella Stand Jasper Wednesday
1887,John Cleese,Smith.
1888,John Cleese,Two.
1889,John Cleese,Norman
1890,Michael Palin,Well* I've just heard from Luton that my auntie's ill* er* possibly* possibly gastro-enteritis - Gerald.
1891,John Cleese,No I'm afraid you can't* we haven't got time. Just to bring you up to date with a few results* er* that you may have missed. Engelbert Humperdinck has taken Barrow-in-Furness* that's a gain from Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. Arthur Negus has held Bristols. That's not a result* that's a bit of gossip. Er...Mary Whitehouse has just taken umbrage. Could it be a bit of trouble there. And apparently Wales is not swinging at all. No surprise there. And...Monty Python has held the credits.
1892,John Cleese,In the fifth century* as the once-mighty Roman Empire crumbled* the soft underbelly of Western Europe lay invitingly exposed to the barbarian hordes to the East. Alaric the Visigoth* Galseric the Vandal and Theodoric the Ostrogoth in turn swept westward in a reign of terror. But none surpassed in power and cruelty the mighty Attila the Hun.
1893,Michael Palin,Ladies and gentlemen* it's the 'The Attila the Hun Show'.
1894,John Cleese,In the second quarter of the fifth century* the Huns became a byword for merciless savagery. Their Khan was the mighty warrior Attila. With his devastating armies he swept across Central Europe.
1895,John Cleese,Oh darling* I'm home.
1896,John Cleese,Not at all bad.
1897,John Cleese,Another merciless sweep across Central Europe.
1898,Michael Palin,Hi* daddy.
1899,John Cleese,Hi* Jenny* hi* Robby.
1900,John Cleese,I want you kids to get a-head.
1901,John Cleese,Hi* Uncle Tom.
1902,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
1903,Michael Palin,It's ...
1904,John Cleese,Yes* it's Attila the Nun.
1905,Michael Palin,A simple country girl who took a vow of eternal brutality.
1906,Michael Palin,Well* I've been going with ministers for five years now and* you know... I think they're wonderful.
1907,Michael Palin,Oh yes* they're nice.
1908,John Cleese,I like the Speaker.
1909,Michael Palin,Have you been talking to television again* dear?
1910,Michael Palin,What about?
1911,Michael Palin,Was it Reginald Bosanquet?
1912,Michael Palin,Did he have his head all bandaged?
1913,Michael Palin,Oh* that'll be Ray Baxter and the boys and girls from 'Tomorrow's World'. Oh* I prefer Reginald Bosanquet* there's not so many of them.
1914,Michael Palin,Really?
1915,Michael Palin,Oh yes* we've been expecting you.
1916,Michael Palin,Oh* blimey. You'd think he was awake all the night* scrabbling down by the wainscotting.
1917,Michael Palin,What?
1918,Michael Palin,Well* down here. You can usually hear them.
1919,Michael Palin,Is it?
1920,Michael Palin,Oh - what are you going to do?
1921,Michael Palin,Oh yeah. There's one here.
1922,John Cleese,Excuse me* is the third test in here?
1923,John Cleese,Oh blimey*
1924,Michael Palin,Blimey.
1925,John Cleese,Hello* is the third test in here* please?
1926,Michael Palin,But soon the killer sheep began to infect other animals with its startling intelligence. Pussy cats began to arrange mortgages* cocker spaniels began to design supermarkets...
1927,Michael Palin,Good evening. Here is the news for Parrots. No parrots were involved in an accident on the M1 today when a lorry carrying high-octane fuel was in collison with a bollard. That's a
1928,Michael Palin,in the Bastille. His daughter Lucy awaits her lover Charles Darney* who we have just learned is in fact the nephew of the Marquis de St Evremond* whose cruelty had placed Manette in the Bastille. Darney arrives to find Lucy tending her aged father.
1929,Michael Palin,And while that's going on* here is the news for gibbons. No gibbons were involved in...
1930,Michael Palin,...were not involved. The Minister of Technology
1931,Michael Palin,today to discuss a £4 million airliner deal....none of them were indigenous to Australia* carried their young in pouches* or ate any of those yummy Eucalyptus leaves.Yum Yum. Thats the news for wombats* and now Attila the Bun!
1932,John Cleese,Well that's all for Attila the Bun* and now - idiots!
1933,John Cleese,Thank you* Mrs Thompson... this is the role that I and members of my family have fulfilled in this village for the past four hundred years... Good morning* Mr Jenkins* ICI have increased their half-yearly dividend* I see.
1934,Michael Palin,Yes* splendid.
1935,John Cleese,That's Mr Jenkins - he's another idiot. And so you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho-social service for this community. Oh* excuse me* a coach party has just arrived. I shall have to fall off the wall* I'm afraid.
1936,Michael Palin,What kind of money is there in idioting?
1937,John Cleese,You've got to know what you're doing. I mean* some people think I'm mad. The villagers say I'm mad* the tourists say I'm mad* well I am mad* but I'm naturally mad. I don't use any chemicals.
1938,John Cleese,Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool.
1939,John Cleese,Eton* Sandhurst and the Guards* ha* ha* ha* ha.
1940,Michael Palin,I can't remember but I've got it written down some where.
1941,Michael Palin,Well left.
1942,John Cleese,Well bred.
1943,John Cleese,Good afternoon and welcome to Lords on the second day of the first test. So far today we've had five hours batting from England and already they're nought for nought. Cowdrey is not out nought. Naughton is not in. Knott is in and is nought for not out. Naughton of Northants got a nasty knock on the nut in the nets last night but it's nothing of note. Next in is Nat Newton of Notts. Not Nutring - Nutting's at nine* er* Nutring knocked neatie nighty knock knock...
1944,John Cleese,... anyway England have played extremely well for nothing* not a sausage* in reply to Iceland's first innings total of 722 for 2 declared* scored yesterday disappointingly fast in only twenty-one overs with lots of wild slogging and boundaries and all sorts of rubbishy things. But the main thing is that England have made an absolutely outstanding start so far* Peter?
1945,John Cleese,Oh* shut up or we'll close the bar. And now Bo Wildeburg is running up to bowl to Cowdrey* he runs up* he bowls to Cowdrey...
1946,John Cleese,... and no shot at all. Extremely well not played there.
1947,John Cleese,Oh shut up* long nose.
1948,John Cleese,No* no the players are having drinks. And now* what's happening? I think Cowdrey's being taken off.
1949,John Cleese,Yes* Cowdrey is being carried off. Well I never. Now who's in next* it should be number three* Natt Newton of Notts... get your hand off my thigh* West... no I don't think it is... I think it's er* it's the sofa ... no it's the Chesterfield! The green Chesterfield is coming in at number three to take guard now.
1950,John Cleese,Oh* shut up* elephant snout. And now the green Chesterfield has taken guard and Iceland are putting on their spin dryer to bowl.
1951,John Cleese,The spin dryer moves back to his mark* it runs out to the wicket* bowls to the table... a little bit short but it's coming in a bit there and it's hit him on the pad... and the table is out* leg before wicket. That is England nought for one.
1952,Michael Palin,And now we leave Lords and go over to Epsom for the three o'clock.
1953,John Cleese,And could we have the next contender* please?
1954,John Cleese,Ha ha ha... Good evening* madam* and your name is?
1955,John Cleese,And what's your name?
1956,John Cleese,Jolly good* I see* and which prize do you have particular eyes on this evening?
1957,John Cleese,The blow on the head.
1958,John Cleese,Jolly good. Well your first question for the blow on the head this evening is: What great opponent of Cartesian dualism resists the reduction of psychological phenomena to physical states?
1959,John Cleese,Well* have a guess.
1960,John Cleese,Is the correct answer!
1961,John Cleese,Jolly good.
1962,John Cleese,Ha ha ha. Who does? And now your second question for the blow on the head is: What is the main food that penguins eat?
1963,John Cleese,No.
1964,John Cleese,No* no* no. What do penguins eat? Penguins.
1965,John Cleese,Yes.
1966,John Cleese,No* no* no.
1967,John Cleese,No* no* what do
1968,John Cleese,eat?
1969,John Cleese,No* no* no. What do penguins eat?
1970,John Cleese,Penguins.
1971,John Cleese,No* no* no* no. I'll give you a clue.
1972,John Cleese,No. no.
1973,John Cleese,No* no!
1974,John Cleese,No. What swims in the sea and gets caught in nets?
1975,John Cleese,No* no.
1976,John Cleese,Yes* that's near enough. I'll give you that. Right* now* Mrs Scum* you have won your prize* do you still want the blow on the head?
1977,John Cleese,I'll offer you a poke in the eye.
1978,John Cleese,A punch in the throat?
1979,John Cleese,All right then* a kick in the kneecap?
1980,John Cleese,Mrs Scum* I'm offering you a boot in the teeth and a dagger up the strap?
1981,John Cleese,Very well then* Mrs Scum* you have won tonight's star prize* the blow on the head.
1982,Michael Palin,Hello. On 'Archaeology Today' tonight I have with me Professor Lucien Kastner of Oslo University.
1983,Michael Palin,How tall are you* professor?
1984,Michael Palin,How tall are you?
1985,Michael Palin,... and an expert in Egyptian tomb paintings. Sir Robert...
1986,Michael Palin,are you really five foot ten?
1987,Michael Palin,Funny* you look much shorter than that to me. Are you slumped forward in your chair at all?
1988,Michael Palin,Extraordinary. Sir Robert Eversley* who's just returned from the excavations in El Ara* and you must be well over six foot. Isn't that right* Sir Robert?
1989,John Cleese,Yes.
1990,Michael Palin,In fact* I think you're six foot five aren't you?
1991,Michael Palin,Oh* that's marvelous. I mean you're a totally different kind of specimen to Professor Kastner. Straight in your seat* erect* firm.
1992,John Cleese,Yes. I thought we were here to discuss archaeology.
1993,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* of course we are* yes* absolutely* you're absolutely right! That's positive thinking for you.
1994,Michael Palin,Sir Robert Eversley* who's very interesting* what have you discovered in the excavations at El Ara?
1995,John Cleese,Well basically we have found a complex of tombs...
1996,Michael Palin,Very good speaking voice.
1997,John Cleese,... which present dramatic evidence of Polynesian influence in Egypt in the third dynasty which is quite remarkable.
1998,Michael Palin,How tall were the Polynesians?
1999,Michael Palin,Sh!
2000,John Cleese,Well* they were rather small* seafaring...
2001,Michael Palin,Short men* were they... eh? All squat and bent up?
2002,John Cleese,Well* I really don't know about that...
2003,Michael Palin,Who were the tall people?
2004,John Cleese,I'm afraid I don't know.
2005,Michael Palin,Who's that very tall tribe in Africa?
2006,John Cleese,Well* this is hardly archaeology.
2007,Michael Palin,The Watutsi! That's it - the Watutsi! Oh* that's the tribe* some of them were eight foot tall. Can you imagine that. Eight foot of Watutsi. Not one on another's shoulders* oh no - eight foot of solid Watutsi. That's what I call tall.
2008,John Cleese,Yes* but it's nothing to do with archaeology.
2009,Michael Palin,Oh to hell with archaeology!
2010,John Cleese,Bloody fool. Look what you've done to him.
2011,Michael Palin,Don't bloody fool me.
2012,John Cleese,I'll do what I like* because I'm six foot five and I eat punks like you for breakfast.
2013,Michael Palin,I'll get you for that* Eversley! I'll get you if I have to travel to the four corners of the earth!
2014,John Cleese,Today I hear the robin sing
2015,John Cleese,Why* a Sumerian drinking vessel of the fourth dynasty.
2016,John Cleese,Catalogue this pot* Danielle* it's fourth dynasty.
2017,John Cleese,Yes* it's... Sumerian.
2018,John Cleese,I'm happy too* now at last we know there was a Sumerian influence here in Abu Simnel in the early pre-dynastic period* two thousand years before the reign of Tutankhamun*
2019,Michael Palin,All right Eversley* get up out of that trench.
2020,John Cleese,Don't forget... I'm six foot five.
2021,Michael Palin,That doesn't worry me... Kastner.
2022,Michael Palin,Up!
2023,John Cleese,Eleven foot three!
2024,John Cleese,Danielle!
2025,Michael Palin,Eleven foot six - damn you! Abdul
2026,John Cleese,Fifteen foot four! Mustapha!
2027,Michael Palin,Nineteen foot three... damn you!
2028,Michael Palin,And there we end this edition of 'Archaeology Today'. Next week* the Silbury Dig by Cole Porter with Pearl Bailey and Arthur Negus.
2029,Michael Palin,And now an appeal for sanity from the Reverend Arthur Belling.
2030,Michael Palin,The Reverend Arthur Belling is Vicar of St Loony Up The Cream Bun and Jam. And now an appeal on behalf of the National Trust.
2031,John Cleese,All right* break it up. What's your number* then? All right. Name?
2032,Michael Palin,Next please. Name?
2033,Michael Palin,Mr Watson.
2034,Michael Palin,Ah* Mr Doctor.
2035,Michael Palin,Oh*
2036,Michael Palin,Doctor.
2037,Michael Palin,Oh* Doctor
2038,Michael Palin,Hello* Mr Darling.
2039,Michael Palin,Hello Doctor Darling.
2040,Michael Palin,Oh ... yes* yes.
2041,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* I suppose so.
2042,Michael Palin,Stokes - John Stokes.
2043,Michael Palin,Oh* er* how do you do.
2044,John Cleese,How do
2045,John Cleese,do.
2046,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* here I am* yes.
2047,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* yes* this is the wife. Yes. Um darling* these* these are the Gits.
2048,Michael Palin,The Gits.
2049,Michael Palin,Oh* no* no. Not at all. No. Um* no* this... this... this is my wife Norah* er* Norah Jane* Norah Jane Stokes. This is Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git. And this is his wife Dreary Fat Boring Old Git.
2050,Michael Palin,Do ... do you live round here?
2051,Michael Palin,Oh.
2052,John Cleese,Hank and Roy Spim are tough* fearless backwoodsmen who have chosen to live in a violent* unrelenting world of nature's creatures* where only the fittest survive. Today they are off to hunt mosquitoes.
2053,John Cleese,Suddenly Hank spots the mosquito they're after.
2054,John Cleese,Now more than ever* they must rely on the skills they have learnt from a lifetime's hunting.
2055,John Cleese,But the hunt is not over. With well practised skill Hank skins the mosquito.
2056,John Cleese,Here* surrounded by their trophies Roy and Hank prepare for a much tougher ordeal - a moth hunt.
2057,John Cleese,For Roy* sport is everything. Ever since he lost his left arm battling with an ant* Roy has risked his life in the pursuit of tiny creatures.
2058,John Cleese,Wherever there is a challenge* Hank and Roy Spim will be there ready to carry on this primordial struggle between man and inoffensive* tiny insects.
2059,Michael Palin,Don't I know it* love.
2060,Michael Palin,You what* love?
2061,Michael Palin,Well* I was quite pleased actually. I was trying to do my butch voice* you know* 'what the jury must understand'* and they loved it* you know. I could see that foreman eyeing me.
2062,Michael Palin,Yes* cheeky devil.
2063,Michael Palin,No* just a minute - I must finish you know. Anyway* I finished up with 'the actions of these vicious men is a violent stain on the community and the full penalty of the law is scarcely sufficient to deal with their ghastly crimes'* and I waggled my wig! Just ever so slightly* but it was a stunning effect.
2064,Michael Palin,Oh* aye.
2065,John Cleese,You don't fool me* you stupid mynah bird. I'm not deaf yet.
2066,John Cleese,Shut up!
2067,John Cleese,Shut your beak. Gott in Himmel... I never get any peace here.
2068,John Cleese,What?
2069,John Cleese,No* I haven't seen the bloody sugar bowl.
2070,John Cleese,Sod the sugar bowl... I'm trying to finish this stinking tune! It's driving me spare ... so shut up!
2071,John Cleese,No* no* no* no* no.
2072,John Cleese,Stuff the jam spoon!
2073,John Cleese,Look* get out you old rat-bag. Buzz off and shut up.
2074,John Cleese,Leave me alone!! ...
2075,John Cleese,... Ha! ha! ha! I've done it* I've done it!
2076,John Cleese,What!!!!
2077,John Cleese,I've forgotten it.
2078,John Cleese,I had it! I had it!
2079,John Cleese,I don't care!!
2080,John Cleese,I
2081,John Cleese,What's that! What's that!
2082,John Cleese,Gott in Himmel* I'm going out.
2083,John Cleese,Pikelets* pikelets. Shakespeare never had this trouble.
2084,John Cleese,You're right. Oh* incidentally* why not call him Hamlet?
2085,Michael Palin,Composer? Huh! I wouldn't wish it on my son. He's a sensitive boy* already. I'd rather he was a sewage attendant or a ratcatcher.
2086,Michael Palin,Aha! Rats at 42a Kartoffelnstrasse. Hey Mitzi! I gotta go to Potato Street.
2087,Michael Palin,Depressed by rats? Do mice get you down? Then why not visit Colin Mozart's Rodent Extermination Boutique. Rats extirpated* mice punished* voles torn apart by Colin Mozart* Munich's leading furry animal liquidator.
2088,Michael Palin,Colin Mozart.
2089,John Cleese,Get out the bloody piano you stupid furry bucktoothed gits! Get out! Gott in Himmel. Get your stinking tail out of my face.
2090,John Cleese,Shut up!
2091,Michael Palin,Yes. Do you remember the Glasgow treason trial?
2092,Michael Palin,No* hen* with the party afterwards.
2093,Michael Palin,That's right. Ooh* he made me want to turn Queen's evidence.
2094,Michael Palin,Anyway* Bailie Anderson.
2095,Michael Palin,Yes. She's so strict. She was on at me for giving dolly sentences* you know* specially in that arson case.
2096,Michael Palin,They preferred the brown wig.
2097,Michael Palin,Ooh! Get back in the witness box* you're too sharp to live!
2098,Michael Palin,Ooh! and again.
2099,Michael Palin,I had a magistrate in Bradford yesterday.
2100,Michael Palin,Oh* aye* of course* they're as bent as safety pins.
2101,Michael Palin,Here are tonight's football results.'
2102,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
2103,Michael Palin,It's...
2104,John Cleese,How to recognize different parts of the body.
2105,John Cleese,Number one. The foot.
2106,John Cleese,Number two. The shoulder.
2107,John Cleese,And number three. The other foot.
2108,John Cleese,Number four. The bridge of the nose.
2109,John Cleese,Number five. The naughty bits.
2110,John Cleese,Number six. Just above the elbow.
2111,John Cleese,Number seven. Two inches to the right of a very naughty bit indeed.
2112,John Cleese,Number eight. The kneecap.
2113,Michael Palin,How are yer Bruce?
2114,Michael Palin,Blimey* s'hot in here* Bruce.
2115,Michael Palin,She's a good Sheila* Bruce and not at all stuck up.
2116,John Cleese,Goodday* Bruce* Hello Bruce* how are you* Bruce? Gentlemen* I'd like to introduce a chap from pommie land... who'll be joining us this year here in the Philosophy Department of the University of Woolamaloo.
2117,John Cleese,Michael Baldwin - this is Bruce. Michael Baldwin - this is Bruce. Michael Baldwin - this is Bruce.
2118,Michael Palin,Mind if we call you 'Bruce' to keep it clear?
2119,John Cleese,Well* Gentlemen* I think we'd better start the meeting. Before we start* though* I'll ask the padre for a prayer.
2120,John Cleese,Crack the tubes* right!
2121,John Cleese,Er* Bruce* I now call upon you to welcome Mr. Baldwin to the Philosophy Department.
2122,John Cleese,Now* Bruce teaches classical philosophy* Bruce teaches Haegelian philosophy* and Bruce here teaches logical positivism* and is also in charge of the sheepdip.
2123,Michael Palin,What's does new Bruce teach?
2124,John Cleese,New Bruce will be teaching political science - Machiavelli* Bentham* Locke* Hobbes* Sutcliffe* Bradman* Lindwall* Miller* Hassett* and Benet.
2125,John Cleese,Oh* spit!
2126,Michael Palin,Howls of derisive laughter* Bruce!
2127,John Cleese,In addition* as he's going to be teaching politics* I've told him he's welcome to teach any of the great socialist thinkers* provided he makes it clear that they were
2128,John Cleese,.
2129,John Cleese,Any questions?
2130,John Cleese,Are you a pooftah?
2131,John Cleese,No right* well gentlemen* I'll just remind you of the faculty rules: Rule one - no pooftahs. Rule two* no member of the faculty is to maltreat the Abbos in any way whatsoever - if there's anybody watching. Rule three - no pooftahs. Rule four - I don't want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out. Rule five - no pooftahs. Rule six - there is
2132,John Cleese,rule six! Rule seven - no pooftahs. That concludes the reading of the rules* Bruce.
2133,John Cleese,Gentlemen* at six o'clock I want every man-Bruce of you in the Sydney Harbour Bridge room to take a glass of sherry with the flying philosopher* Bruce* and I call upon you* padre* to close the meeting with a prayer.
2134,John Cleese,OK.
2135,Michael Palin,This should tide us over 'til lunchtime.
2136,John Cleese,Number nine. The ear.
2137,John Cleese,Number ten. The big toe.
2138,John Cleese,Number eleven. More naughty bits.
2139,John Cleese,Number twelve. The naughty bits of a lady*
2140,John Cleese,Number thirteen. The naughty bits of a horse*
2141,John Cleese,Number fourteen. The naughty bits of an ant.
2142,John Cleese,Number fifteen. The naughty bits of Reginald Maudling.
2143,John Cleese,Number sixteen. The hand.
2144,Michael Palin,Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight Mr Norman St. John Polevaulter* who for the last few years has been contradicting people...Mr Polevaulter* why do you contradict people?
2145,Michael Palin,You told me that you did.
2146,Michael Palin,Oh. I see. I'll start again.
2147,Michael Palin,Ssh! Mr Polevaulter I understand you don't contradict people.
2148,Michael Palin,And when
2149,Michael Palin,you start contradicting people?
2150,Michael Palin,1952?
2151,Michael Palin,Twenty-three years ago.
2152,John Cleese,And so on and so on and so on. And now...
2153,John Cleese,Number seventeen. The top of the head.
2154,John Cleese,Number eighteen...the feather* rare.
2155,John Cleese,Number nineteen. The nose.
2156,John Cleese,Come in.
2157,John Cleese,Ah! Mr Luxury Yacht. Do sit down* please.
2158,John Cleese,Well* do sit down then Mr Throatwobbler Mangrove.
2159,John Cleese,Now* what seems to be the trouble?
2160,John Cleese,I see. And which particular feature of your anatomy is causing you distress?
2161,John Cleese,Yes. To be absolutely blunt you're worried about your enormous hooter.
2162,John Cleese,No?
2163,John Cleese,Yes* and you want me to hack a bit off.
2164,John Cleese,Fine. It is a startler* isn't it? Er* do you mind if I... er.
2165,John Cleese,Oh* no nothing* then* well* I'll just examine your nose.
2166,John Cleese,Mr Luxury Yacht* this nose of yours is false. It's made of polystyrene and your own hooter's a beaut. No pruning necessary.
2167,John Cleese,Well* you've had the operation* you strange person.
2168,John Cleese,Well* all right* all right* but only ... if you come on a camping holiday with me.
2169,Michael Palin,Next week we'll be showing you how to pick up an architect* how to pull a prime minister* and how to have fun with a wholesale poulterer. But now the men of the Derbyshire Light Infantry entertain us with a precision display of bad temper.
2170,Michael Palin,And next the men of the Second Armoured Division regale us with their famous close order swanning about.
2171,Michael Palin,And finally...
2172,Michael Palin,Six hours.
2173,John Cleese,There have been many stirring tales told of the sea and also some fairly uninteresting ones only marginally connected with it* like this one. Sorry* this isn't a very good announcement. Sorry.
2174,John Cleese,And here is the result of the 'Where to put Edward Heath's statue Competition. The winner was a Mr Ivy North who wins ten guineas and a visit to the Sailors Quarters.
2175,John Cleese,That was last year's re-enactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor performed by the Batley Townswomen's Guild. It was written* directed and produced by Mrs Rita Fairbanks.
2176,Michael Palin,And what are your ladies going to do for us this year?
2177,Michael Palin,Well off we go* then with the Barley Townswomen's Guild re-enactment of the first heart transplant.
2178,John Cleese,The first heart transplant. But this is not the only open-air production here that has used the sea. Theatrical managers in this area have not been slow to appreciate the sea's tremendous dramatic value. And somewhere* out in this bay* is the first underwater production of 'Measure for Measure'.
2179,John Cleese,The underwater version of 'Measure for Measure'* and further out to sea 'Hello Dolly' is also doing good business.
2180,John Cleese,... and over there on the oyster beds Formula 2 car racing.
2181,John Cleese,Number twenty. The armpits.
2182,John Cleese,Number twenty-one. The bottom two-thirds of the nape of the neck.
2183,John Cleese,Number twenty-two. The nipple.
2184,John Cleese,...and that concludes the week's episode of 'How to Recognize Different Parts of the Body'* adapted for radio by Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband* Pip. And now we present the first episode of a new radio drama series* 'The Death of Mary* Queen of Scots.' Part One: The Beginning.
2185,John Cleese,Episode two of 'The Death of Mary* Queen of Scots'* can be heard on Radio 4 almost immediately.
2186,John Cleese,That was episode two of 'The Death of Mary* Queen of Scots'* adapted for radio by Bernard Hollowood and Brian London. And now* Radio Four will explode.
2187,John Cleese,Yes
2188,John Cleese,Looks like a penguin.
2189,John Cleese,Oh.
2190,John Cleese,It's funny that penguin being there innit? What's it doing there?
2191,John Cleese,I can see that!
2192,John Cleese,We'll have to watch that. Unless it's a male.
2193,John Cleese,Yes* looks fairly butch.
2194,John Cleese,Penguins don't come from next door* they come from the Antarctic.
2195,John Cleese,Why did say Burma?
2196,John Cleese,Oh. Perhaps it's from the zoo.
2197,John Cleese,How should I know which zoo? I'm not Doctor bloody Bernowski.
2198,John Cleese,He knows everything.
2199,John Cleese,No it wouldn't. They don't stamp animals 'property of the zoo'. You can't stamp a huge lion.
2200,John Cleese,What happens when they moult?
2201,John Cleese,No* but penguins do. There* I've run rings around you logically.
2202,John Cleese,Number twenty-three. The shin.
2203,John Cleese,Number twenty-four. Reginald's Maulding's shin
2204,John Cleese,Number twenty-five. The brain.
2205,John Cleese,Number twenty-six. Magaret Thatcher's brain.
2206,John Cleese,Number twenty-seven. More naughty bits.
2207,John Cleese,Number twenty-eight. The naughty bits of the cabinet.
2208,John Cleese,Number twenty-nine. The interior of a country house.
2209,John Cleese,That's not a part of the body.
2210,John Cleese,No* it's the end of the series* they must be running out of ideas.
2211,Michael Palin,All right* don't anybody move* there's been a murder.
2212,Michael Palin,No... no ... not a murder... no what's like a murder but begins with B?
2213,Michael Palin,No ... no ... no ... no ... no...
2214,John Cleese,Burnley?
2215,Michael Palin,Burnley - that's right! Burnley in Lancashire. There's been a Burnley.
2216,Michael Palin,Burglary. Yes* good man. Burglary - that's it* of course. There's been a burglary.
2217,John Cleese,Where?
2218,Michael Palin,In the back* just below the rib.
2219,John Cleese,No - that's murder.
2220,Michael Palin,Oh... er no... in the band... In the bat... Barclays bat.
2221,Michael Palin,Yes. Nasty business - got away with £23*000.
2222,Michael Palin,Any what?
2223,Michael Palin,Any clues* eh? Oh* we don't half talk posh* don't we? I suppose you say 'ehnvelope' and 'larngerie' and 'sarndwiches on the settee'! Well this is a murder investigation* young man* and murder is a very serious business.
2224,John Cleese,I thought you said it was a burglary.
2225,Michael Palin,Burglary is almost as serious a business as murder. Some burglaries are more serious than murder. A burglary in which someone gets stabbled is murder! So don't come these petty distinctions with me. You're as bad as a judge. Right* now! The first thing to do in the event of a breach of the peace of any kind* is to... go...
2226,Michael Palin,and ... oh* sorry* sorry* I was miles away.
2227,John Cleese,Ring the police?
2228,Michael Palin,Ring the police. Yes* that's a good idea. Get them over here fast ... no* on second thoughts* get them over here slowly* so they don't drop anything.
2229,Michael Palin,Make what you like* Boskovitch - it won't help you in court.
2230,Michael Palin,I'm sorry* sorry. That's the trouble with being on two cases at once. I keep thinking I've got Boskovitch cornered and in fact I'm investigating a Burnley.
2231,Michael Palin,Burglary! Yes - good man.
2232,John Cleese,Who's Boskovitch?
2233,Michael Palin,Hah! Boskovitch is a Russian scientist who is passing information to the Russians.
2234,Michael Palin,Oh* there he goes again! 'Classified information'! Oh* sitting on the 'settee' with our 'scones' and our 'classified information'!
2235,Michael Palin,Ah! Hello* Duckie.
2236,Michael Palin,I'm fine thanks. How are you?
2237,Michael Palin,Why's that* Duckie?
2238,Michael Palin,A lovely song* Duckie.
2239,Michael Palin,And so* Inspector Zatapathique* the forensic expert from the Monaco Murder Squad sings his song 'Bing Tiddle Tiddle Bong'.
2240,John Cleese,Number thirty-one. The end.
2241,John Cleese,Oh* there you are. Hello. Hello. No problem. Have a drink. Have a drink. Great. Hello. Marvellous. Marvellous. Hello. Rewrite. Oh this is really great. I mean* it's really saying something* don't you think?
2242,John Cleese,Yes* yes. Great. Perfect. No* no* we haven't started yet. No. But great - great.
2243,John Cleese,Great. Terrific. Oh it's great. No problem. We'll sort it out on the floor. Sort it out on the floor. No problem. This film is basically pro-humanity and anti-bad things and it rips aside the hypocritical facade of our society's gin and tonic and leaves a lot of sacred cows rolling around in agony* have a drink* have a drink.
2244,John Cleese,Yes* great. Oh* marvellous.
2245,John Cleese,I thought we cut that? Didn't we cut that?
2246,John Cleese,We didn't. Oh great. That's even better. I'll put it back in. Rewrite.
2247,John Cleese,This is the scene - outside the tent - it's all bloody marvelous. It makes you want to throw up.
2248,Michael Palin,Hi* Oatesy. Sure is a beautiful day already.
2249,John Cleese,Great* great.
2250,Michael Palin,What? What are you saying?
2251,John Cleese,I was just saying great* great. Cue Evans.
2252,Michael Palin,Good morning* Miss Evans.
2253,John Cleese,What's her line? What's her line?
2254,John Cleese,Great. Great. Rewrite. Cue.
2255,John Cleese,Great! We'll shoot it.
2256,Michael Palin,Are you sure that's right?
2257,John Cleese,Oh* it's great.
2258,John Cleese,Jim! Jim! Oh* me!
2259,John Cleese,Great! Where are they?
2260,John Cleese,I don't know. I was getting confused.
2261,John Cleese,Great ... Oh* I know. I'm going to dig a pit for Scott and put a box in Vanilla's trench.
2262,Michael Palin,Say* why don't I take the boxes off and Vanilla get up out of the trench?
2263,John Cleese,It wouldn't work... It's even better! Great. Rewrite!
2264,John Cleese,Oh* it's easy. I've worked it out. Scott takes his boxes off and you don't stand in the trench.
2265,John Cleese,Even better. Great.
2266,John Cleese,Oh well* could you just try it?
2267,John Cleese,Great. Great everyone. Lunch now. Lunch. It's all in the can. Good morning's work.
2268,John Cleese,Just keeping morale up.
2269,John Cleese,Got to keep the lion. It's great!
2270,John Cleese,Great. We're losing the lion. Rewrite. Lose the lion everyone. That's fantastic.
2271,Michael Palin,What's this about our losing the lion?
2272,Michael Palin,Why?
2273,Michael Palin,I get to fight the lion.
2274,Michael Palin,Listen* I gotta fight the lion. That's what that guy Scott's all about. I know. I've studied him already.
2275,John Cleese,Great!
2276,Michael Palin,Fight a rotten penguin?
2277,Michael Palin,The lion is in the contract.
2278,John Cleese,Even better. Great. Have a drink. Lose the penguin. Stand by to shoot.
2279,Michael Palin,Booming out of the pages of history comes a story of three men and one woman whose courage shocked a generation.
2280,Michael Palin,From the same team that brought you ...
2281,Michael Palin,Lawrence of Glareorgan' ... 'Bridge Over the River Trent' ... 'The Mad Woman of Biggleswade' ... and 'Krakatoa* East of Leamington' ... comes the story of three people and a woman united by fate who set out in search of the fabled Pole of the Sahara and found ... themselves. See ... Lieutenant Scott's death struggle with a crazed desert lion.
2282,Michael Palin,See Ensign Oates' frank adult death struggle with the spine-chilling giant electric penguin...
2283,Michael Palin,... See Miss Evans pursued by the man-eating roll-top writing desk.
2284,John Cleese,And now for something completely different.
2285,Michael Palin,It's...
2286,John Cleese,Excuse me* I would like to buy a fish license* please.
2287,John Cleese,Hello* I would like to buy a fish licence* please.
2288,Michael Palin,A what?
2289,John Cleese,A license for my pet fish* Eric.
2290,Michael Palin,How did you know my name was Eric?
2291,John Cleese,No no no* my
2292,John Cleese,name is Eric* Eric the fish. 'E's an 'alibut.
2293,John Cleese,He is an halibut.
2294,Michael Palin,You've got a pet halibut?
2295,John Cleese,Yes. I chose him out of thousands. I didn't like the others* they were all too flat.
2296,Michael Palin,You must be a loony.
2297,John Cleese,I am not a looney! Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely because I have a pet halibut? I've heard tell that Sir Gerald Nabardo has a pet prawn called Simon and you wouldn't call him a looney; furthermore* Dawn Pailthorpe* the lady show-jumper* had a clam* called Stafford* after the late Chancellor* Allan Bullock has two pikes* both called Chris* and Marcel Proust had an haddock! So* if you're calling the author of 'A la recherche du temps perdu' a looney* I shall have to ask you to step outside!
2298,Michael Palin,All right* all right* all right. You want a licence.
2299,John Cleese,Yes.
2300,Michael Palin,For a fish.
2301,Michael Palin,You
2302,Michael Palin,a loony.
2303,John Cleese,Look* it's a bleeding pet* isn't it? I've got a license for me pet dog Eric* and I've got a license for me pet cat Eric...
2304,Michael Palin,You don't need a license for a cat.
2305,John Cleese,I bleeding well do and I got one. Ho* ho* you're not catching me out there.
2306,Michael Palin,There's no such thing as a bloody cat license.
2307,John Cleese,Yes there is!
2308,Michael Palin,No there isn't!
2309,John Cleese,Is!
2310,Michael Palin,Isn't!
2311,John Cleese,What's that then?
2312,Michael Palin,This is a dog license with the word 'dog' crossed out and the word 'cat' written in in crayon.
2313,John Cleese,The man didn't have the proper form.
2314,Michael Palin,What man?
2315,John Cleese,The man from the cat detector van.
2316,Michael Palin,Loony detector van* you mean.
2317,John Cleese,It's people like you what cause unrest.
2318,Michael Palin,All right* what cat detector van?
2319,John Cleese,The cat detector van from the Ministry of Housinge.
2320,Michael Palin,Housinge?
2321,John Cleese,It was spelt like that on the van. I'm very observant!. I never seen so many bleeding aerials. The man said that their equipment could pinpoint a purr at four hundred yards...and Eric* being such a happy cat* was a piece of cake.
2322,Michael Palin,How much did you pay for this?
2323,John Cleese,Sixty quid* and eight guineas for the fruit bat.
2324,Michael Palin,What fruit bat?
2325,John Cleese,Eric the fruit-bat.
2326,Michael Palin,Are all your pets called Eric?
2327,John Cleese,There's nothing so odd about that: Kemal Ataturk had an entire menagerie* all called Abdul!
2328,Michael Palin,No he didn't!
2329,John Cleese,He did* he did* he did* he did and did. There you are. 'Kemal Ataturk* the Man' by E. W. Swanton with a foreword by Paul Anka* page 91* please.
2330,Michael Palin,I owe you an apology* sir.
2331,John Cleese,Spoken like a gentleman* sir. Now* are you going to give me a fish license?
2332,Michael Palin,I promise you that there is no such thing. You don't need one.
2333,John Cleese,Then I would like a statement to that effect signed by the Lord Mayor.
2334,Michael Palin,You're in luck.
2335,John Cleese,And now* there is the Mayor. Surely the third tallest mayor in Derby's history. And there are the Aldermen magnificently resplendent in their Aldermanic hose and just look at the power in those thighs. The New Zealanders are going to find it pretty tough going in the set pieces in the second half... So Dawn Palethorpe with one clear round on Sir Gerald... and now the Mayor has reached the Great Customer Mr Eric Praline.
2336,John Cleese,has finally gone spare and there is the going sparal look on the front of his head. And now the Aldermen are finishing their oranges and leaving the post office for the start of the second half.
2337,John Cleese,And here come the Derby Council XV following the All Blacks out on to the pitch. There* in the centre of the picture you can see Dawn Palethorpe on Sir Gerald - one of the fastest wingers we must have seen in England this season. On the left hand side of the picture the Lord Mayor has been running such wonderful possession for Derby Council in the lines out and it's the All Blacks to kick off. Wilson to kick off. Oh* I can see there the Chairman of the By-ways and Highways Committee who's obviously recovered from that very nasty blow he got in that loose ball in the first half.
2338,John Cleese,And Wilson kicks off and it's the Town Clerk's taken the ball beautifully there* the All Blacks are up on it very fast and the whistle has gone. I'm not quite sure what happened there* I couldn't see* but there's a scrum-down. I think it's an All Blacks' ball. They were upon them very fast. Obviously they're going to try very hard in this half to wipe out this five-point deficit. Derby Council eight points to three up and Derby Council have got the ball against the head. There is the Borough Surveyor* the scrum-half is out of the ... er* the Chairman of the Highway and By-way Committee who's kicked for touch. The line out - and it's into the line out and the Mayor has got the ball again. To the Borough Surveyor who's left out the Medical Officer of Health. Straight along the line to the Lady Mayoress and the Lady Mayoress has got to go through. Number two has missed her - he's taken to the full back - only the full back to beat and she has scored! The Lady Mayoress has scored* it's eleven points to three.
2339,Michael Palin,Cliff* this must have been a very disappointing result for the All Blacks.
2340,Michael Palin,And what about China?
2341,Michael Palin,Well* thank you Cliff. Tonight's other outstanding match was the semi-final between the Bournemouth Gynaecologists and the Watford Long John Silver Impersonators. We bring you edited highlights of the match.
2342,Michael Palin,Well* that's about it for tonight ladies and gentlemen* but remember if you've enjoyed watching the show just half as much as we've enjoyed doing it* then we've enjoyed it twice as much as you. Ha* ha* ha.
2343,John Cleese,Come in.
2344,John Cleese,Ah* Frog.
2345,John Cleese,Shut up* I want to have a word with you* Frog.
2346,John Cleese,Shut up. It's about your advertising campaign for Conquistador Coffee. Now* I've had the managing director of Conquistador to see me this morning and he's very unhappy with your campaign. Very unhappy. In fact* he's shot himself.
2347,John Cleese,No* extremely well.
2348,John Cleese,* the effect of which was how disappointed he was with your work and* in particular* why you had changed the name from Conquistador Instant Coffee to Conquistador Instant Leprosy. Why* Frog?
2349,John Cleese,Shut up. Why did you do it?
2350,John Cleese,A joke?
2351,John Cleese,I see* Frog.
2352,John Cleese,Shut up. Now* let's have a look at the sales chart.
2353,John Cleese,When you took over this account* Frog* Conquistador was a brand leader. Here you introduced your first campaign* 'Conquistador Coffee brings a new meaning to the word vomit'. Here you made your special introductory offer of a free dead dog with every jar* and this followed your second campaign 'the tingling fresh coffee which brings you exciting new cholera* mange* dropsy* the clap* hard pad and athlete's head. From the House of Conquistador'.
2354,John Cleese,Why* Frog?
2355,John Cleese,Shut up! Well?
2356,John Cleese,They certainly do know the name - they burnt the factory down. The owner is hiding in my bathroom
2357,John Cleese,Fire you? Three men dead* the factory burnt down* the account lost and our firm completely bankrupt* what... what... what ... can you possibly say? What excuse can you possibly make?
2358,John Cleese,Oh* yes. Oh* incidentally your film's won a prize.
2359,John Cleese,Sorry about that. And now for something completely diff...
2360,John Cleese,something completely diff... completely diff... completely diff... completely diff... completely different.
2361,Michael Palin,It's...
2362,John Cleese,1929. Stanley Baldwin's Conservative Government is defeated and Ramsay MacDonald becomes* for the second time* Prime Minister of England.
2363,Michael Palin,My* it's hot in here.
2364,John Cleese,Hello* come in.
2365,John Cleese,Ah* hello* hello* how much do you want for that briefcase?
2366,John Cleese,All right then* the briefcase and the umbrella. A fiver down* must be my final offer.
2367,John Cleese,Oh* take a seat* take a seat.
2368,John Cleese,I see you chose the canvas chair with the aluminium frame. I'll throw that in and a fiver* for the briefcase and the umbrella ... no* make it fair* the briefcase and the umbrella and the two pens in your breast pocket and the chair's yours and a fiver and a pair of ex-German U-boat commander's binoculars.
2369,John Cleese,Not for sale* what does that mean?
2370,John Cleese,Oh yeah* right. Ah* OK* ah. How much experience in journalism?
2371,John Cleese,Right* typing speed?
2372,John Cleese,O Levels?
2373,John Cleese,A Levels?
2374,John Cleese,Right... Well* I'll give you the job* and the chair* and an all-wool ex-army sleeping bag ... for the briefcase* umbrella* the pens in your breast pocket and your string vest.
2375,John Cleese,Monday.
2376,John Cleese,If you throw in the shoes as well.
2377,John Cleese,Hello* er ... Miss Johnson? Could we have two coffees and biscuits please?
2378,John Cleese,Two ex-army greatcoats and the alarm clock and a table lamp* for two coffees and biscuits.
2379,John Cleese,Two greatcoats* one table lamp and a desert boat.
2380,John Cleese,Done.
2381,Michael Palin,Or Shrill Petrol with the new addititve GLC 9424075. After 6 p.m.* 9424047. Using this white card
2382,Michael Palin,Aaaagh!
2383,Michael Palin,Hello everyone.
2384,Michael Palin,Where's daddy?
2385,Michael Palin,Oh golly! Has he been... ?
2386,Michael Palin,Then ... he won't be needing his reservation on the 10.15.
2387,Michael Palin,And I suppose as his eldest son it must go to me.
2388,Michael Palin,Oh* but surely he simply shot himself and then hid the gun.
2389,Michael Palin,Ha* ha! Well* I must dash or I'll be late for the 10.15.
2390,Michael Palin,I may have had the motive* inspector* but I could not have done it* for I have only just arrived from Gillingham on the 8.13 and here's my restaurant car ticket to prove it.
2391,Michael Palin,Oh* er... did I say the 8.13* I meant the 7.58 stopping train.
2392,Michael Palin,Oh* er* simple! I caught the 7.16 Football Special arriving at Swindon at 8.09.
2393,Michael Palin,Oh* yes! How daft of me. Of course* I came on the Holidaymaker Special calling at Bedford* Colmworth* Fen Dinon* Sutton* Wallington and Gillingham.
2394,Michael Palin,Damn. All right* I confess I did it. I killed him for his reservation* but you won't take me alive! I'm going to throw myself under the 10.12 from Reading.
2395,Michael Palin,Exactly.
2396,John Cleese,Some people have made the mistake of seeing Shunt's work as a load of rubbish about railway timetables* but clever people like me* who talk loudly in restaurants* see this as a deliberate ambiguity* a plea for understanding in a mechanized world. The points are frozen* the beast is dead. What is the difference? What indeed is the point? The point is frozen* the beast is late out of Paddington. The point is taken. If La Fontaine's elk would spurn Tom Jones the engine must be our head* the dining car our oesophagus* the guard's van our left lung* the cattle truck our shins* the first-class compartment the piece of skin at the nape of the neck and the level crossing an electric elk called Simon. The clarity is devastating. But where is the ambiguity? It's over there in a box. Shunt is saying the 8.15 from Gillingham when in reality he means the 8.13 from Gillingham. The train is the same only the time is altered. Ecce homo* ergo elk. La Fontaine knew his sister and knew her bloody well. The point is taken* the beast is moulting* the fluff gets up your nose. The illusion is complete; it is reality* the reality is illusion and the ambiguity is the only truth. But is the truth* as Hitchcock observes* in the box? No there isn't room* the ambiguity has put on weight. The point is taken* the elk is dead* the beast stops at Swindon* Chabrol stops at nothing* I'm having treatment and La Fontaine can get knotted.
2397,Michael Palin,Gavin Millar...
2398,Michael Palin,... was not talking to Neville Shunt. From the world of the theatre we turn to the world of dental hygiene. No* no* no* no. From the world of the theatre we move to the silver screen. We honour one of the silver screen's outstanding writer-dentists... writer-directors* Martin Curry who is visiting London to have a tooth out* for the pre-molar* er... premiere of his filling* film next Toothday... Tuesday* at the Dental Theatre... Film Theatre. Martin Curry talking to Matthew Palate... Padget.
2399,Michael Palin,Sir?
2400,John Cleese,It wasn't true to life.
2401,Michael Palin,Well I've been in the city for over forty years and I think the importance of looking after poor people cannot be understressed.
2402,John Cleese,Well* I've been in the city all my life and I'm as alert and active as I've ever been.
2403,John Cleese,Well l've been in the city for thirty years and I've never once regretted being a nasty* greedy* cold hearted* avaricious* money-grubber ... Conservative.
2404,John Cleese,Well I've been in the sea for thirty-three years and I've never regretted it.
2405,John Cleese,I think it must be a naturalist outing.
2406,John Cleese,Oh* Mrs Collins* you did say you were nervous* didn't you? You have eyes on the coffee machine?
2407,Michael Palin,I don't mind* I don't mind - it's just nice to be here* Reverend.
2408,John Cleese,Oh* Mrs Collins* you had eyes on the coffee machine. Well you have won tonight's star prize: the entire Norwich City Council.
2409,Michael Palin,I've got one already.
2410,John Cleese,Sarah* today's diocesan lovely is enough to make any chap go down on his knees. This twenty-three-year-old bishop hails appropriately enough from Bishop's Stortford and lists her hobbies as swimming* riding* and film producers. What a gas! Bet she's no novice when it comes to converting all in her See.
2411,Michael Palin,I'm starting a war for peace.
2412,Michael Palin,Cor blimey. I'm raising polecats for peace.
2413,John Cleese,Our religion is the first Church to cater for the naughty type of person. If you'd like a bit of 'love-your-neighbour' - and who doesn't now and again - then see Vera and Ciceley during the hymns.
2414,Michael Palin,In our Church we try to help people to help themselves - to cars* washing machines* lead piping* no questions asked. We are the only Church* apart from the Baptists* to do respray jobs.
2415,John Cleese,I would like to come in here for a moment if I may* and disassociate our Church from these frivolous and offensive religions. We are primarily concerned with what is best...
2416,John Cleese,... for the human soul.
2417,John Cleese,In this picture there are forty people. None of them can be seen. In this film we hope to show how not to be seen.
2418,John Cleese,This is Mr E. R. Bradshaw* of Napier Court* Black Lion Road* SE5. He cannot be seen. Now I'm going to ask him to stand up. Mr Bradshaw will you stand up please?
2419,John Cleese,This demonstrates the value of not being seen.
2420,John Cleese,In this picture we canot see Mrs. B.J. Smegma of 13* The Cresent* Belmont. Mrs Smegma will you stand up please.
2421,John Cleese,This is Mr Nesbitt of Harlow New Town. Mr Nesbit would you stand up please.
2422,John Cleese,Yes it was the middle one.
2423,John Cleese,Mr Ken Andrews* of Leighton Road* Slough* has concealed himself extremely well. He could be almost anywhere. He could be behind the wall* inside the water barrel* beneath a pile of leaves* up in the tree* squatting down behind the car* concealed in a hollow* or crouched behind any one of a hundred bushes. However we happen to know he's in the water barrel.
2424,John Cleese,Mr. and Mrs. Watson of 'Ivy Cottage'* Worplesdon Road* Hull* chose a very cunning way of not being seen. When we called at their house* we found that they had gone away on two weeks holiday. They had not left any forwading address* and they had bolted and barred the house to prevent us getting in. However a neighbour told us where there were.
2425,John Cleese,And here is the neighbour who told us where they were
2426,Michael Palin,Ah* well I'm afraid we have to stop the film there* as some of the scenes which followed were of a violent nature which might have proved distressing to some of our viewers. Though not to me* I can tell you.
2427,Michael Palin,first of all* congratulations on the victory.
2428,Michael Palin,It should send you back to Botty with a big lead.
2429,Michael Palin,Well at the moment* Ludovic* you're crouching down inside a filing cabinet.
2430,Michael Palin,I see. Is this through fear?
2431,Michael Palin,Ha* ha* ha* but of course they can still hear you.
2432,Michael Palin,Ludovic Grayson* thank you very much for coming on the program tonight. And we end the show with music. And here with their very latest recording 'Yummy* Yummy* Yummy* I've got love in my tummy' Jackie Charlton and the Tonettes.
2433,John Cleese,And now for something completely different...
2434,Michael Palin,It's...
2435,Michael Palin,Thank you very much for the change* Mr Tobacconist.
2436,Michael Palin,Was that all right?
2437,John Cleese,I will not buy this record* it is scratched.
2438,John Cleese,Ah! I will not buy this tobacconist's* it is scratched.
2439,John Cleese,Yes* cigarettes. My hovercraft is full of eels.
2440,John Cleese,My hovercraft is full of eels.
2441,John Cleese,Yah* yah.
2442,John Cleese,Er* do you want ... do you want to come back to my place* bouncy bouncy?
2443,John Cleese,You great pouf.
2444,John Cleese,If I said you had a beautiful body* would you hold it against me? I am no longer infected.
2445,John Cleese,You have beautiful thighs.
2446,John Cleese,Drop your panties* Sir William* I cannot wait till lunchtime.
2447,John Cleese,My nipples explode with delight.
2448,Michael Palin,Oh I am.
2449,Michael Palin,I am.
2450,Michael Palin,Not guilty.
2451,Michael Palin,I do live at 46* Horton Terrace.
2452,Michael Palin,I am the director of a publishing company.
2453,Michael Palin,My company does publish phrasebooks.
2454,Michael Palin,Yes.
2455,Michael Palin,I did.
2456,Michael Palin,I wish to plead incompetence.
2457,John Cleese,M'lud - this is Abigail Tesler.
2458,John Cleese,Yes* m'lud. Twenty-three-year-old Abigail hails from down under* where they're upside down about her. Those Aussies certainly know a thing or two when it comes to beach belles. Bet some life-saver wouldn't mind giving her the kiss of life. So watch out for sharks* Abigail!
2459,Michael Palin,All will be revealed soon m'lud* quipped tall forty-two-year-old Nelson Bedowes. Cutie QC Nelson's keen on negligence and grievous bodily harm at Gray's Inn. And with cases like he's won we bet Gray's in when Nelson's around.

2466,Michael Palin,Got a family of your own 'ave you?
2467,Michael Palin,You don't have to tell me* son.
2468,Michael Palin,Aren't they marvelous? The strength and boldness... life and power in those colours.
2469,Michael Palin,Oh indeed - if only for the composition alone. The strength of those foreground figures ... the firmness of the line...
2470,Michael Palin,Here is the News...
2471,John Cleese,What am I bid for Vermeer's 'Lady Who Used to be at a Window'? Do I hear two bob?
2472,John Cleese,Gone. Now what am I bid for another great bargain? Edward Landseer's 'Nothing at Bay'.
2473,Michael Palin,All we bloody want is a little bit of bloody consultation.
2474,Michael Palin,At a mass meeting at Brentford Football Ground* other works of art voted to come out in support of the paintings.
2475,Michael Palin,Meanwhile* at Television Centre work began again on a sketch about Ypres. A spokesman for the sketch said: he fully expected it to be more sensible this time.
2476,Michael Palin,Jenkins.
2477,Michael Palin,What are you going to do when you get back to Blighty?
2478,Michael Palin,Got a family of your own* have you?
2479,Michael Palin,You don't have to tell me* son.
2480,Michael Palin,Can we get through* sir?
2481,Michael Palin,Right* sir. We're all with yer.
2482,Michael Palin,Well there's you* me* Jenkins* Padre* Kipper* there's five* sir.
2483,Michael Palin,Four* sir.
2484,John Cleese,I'm a gonner* major. Leave me* I'm ... I'm not a complete man anymore.
2485,John Cleese,Yes. Damn silly really.
2486,Michael Palin,Looks like you* sir.
2487,Michael Palin,No* shortest* sir.
2488,Michael Palin,Not stone* sir.
2489,Michael Palin,No arms* sir.
2490,John Cleese,Stop it! Stop it! Stop this ... this hideous façade.
2491,Michael Palin,Easy* padre!
2492,John Cleese,No* no* I must speak. When I* when I came to this war* I had two arms* two good arms* but when the time came to... to lose one* I .. I gave it gladly* I smiled as they cut if off*
2493,Michael Palin,A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse.
2494,Michael Palin,Good evening. First take a bunch of flowers.
2495,Michael Palin,Get in! Get in! Get in!
2496,John Cleese,Great boobies* honeybun* my lower intestine is full of spam* egg* spam* bacon* spam* tomato* spam ...
2497,John Cleese,My nipples explode...
2498,Michael Palin,Another great Viking victory was at the Green Midget cafe at Bromley. Once again the Viking strategy was the same. They sailed from these fiords here*
2499,Michael Palin,assembled at Trondheim and waited for the strong north-easterly winds to blow their oaken galleys to England whence they sailed on May 23rd. Once in Bromley they assembled in the Green Midget cafe and spam selecting a spam particular spam item from the spam menu would spam* spam* spam* spam* spam ...
2500,Michael Palin,Haagbard Etheldronga and his Viking hordes are currently appearing in 'Grin and Pillage it' at the Jodrell Theatre* Colwyn Bay. 'The Dirty Hungarian Phrase Book' is available from Her Majesty's Stationery Office* price - a kiss on the bum.
2501,John Cleese,Ladies and gentlemen* I am not simply going to say 'and now for something completely different' this week* as I do not think it fit. This is a particularly auspicious occasion for us this evening* as we have been told that Her Majesty the Queen will be watching part of the show tonight. We don't know exactly when Her Majesty will be tuning in. We understand that at the moment she is watching 'The Virginian'* but we have been promised that we will be informed the moment that she changes channel. Her majesty would like everyone to behave quite normally but her equerry has asked me to request all of you at home to stand when the great moment arrives* although we here in the studio will be carrying on with our humorous vignettes and spoofs in the ordinary way. Thank you. And now without any more ado and completely as normal* here are the opening titles.
2502,John Cleese,The coal miners of Wales have long been famed for their tough rugged life hewing the black gold from the uncompromising hell of one mile under. This is
2503,John Cleese,the story of such men* battling gallantly against floods* roof falls* the English criminal law* the hidden killer carbon monoxide and the ever-present threat of pneumoconiosis which is... a disease miners get.
2504,Michael Palin,He's thinking of the Treaty of bloody Westphalia.
2505,Michael Palin,You don't know the difference between the Battle of Borodino and a tiger's bum.
2506,John Cleese,No idea. Sorry.
2507,Michael Palin,Still no settlement in the coal mine dispute at Llanddarog. Miners refused to return to work until the management define a metope. Meanwhile* at Dagenham the unofficial strike committee at Fords have increased their demands to thirteen reasons why Henry III was a bad king. And finally* in the disgusting objects international at Wembley tonight* England beat Spain by a plate of braised pus to a putrid heron. And now* the Toad Elevating Moment.
2508,John Cleese,G... e...
2509,John Cleese,N...
2510,Michael Palin,.... oo ...... ni...
2511,Michael Palin,. .. u... i... a...
2512,Michael Palin,... oo ...... ni...

2515,Michael Palin,. .. oo...
2516,John Cleese,Eve...
2517,Michael Palin,... ni...
2518,Michael Palin,I love the surgical garment. Enjoy the delights of the Victor Mature abdominal corset. Sail down the Nile on the Bleed-it Kosher Truss.
2519,Michael Palin,And don't forget the Hercules Hold-'em-in* the all.purpose concrete truss for the man with the family hernia.
2520,John Cleese,SHUT UP! ... THEY ARE QUITE HAPPY WITH BREADCRUMBS* ANT'S EGGS AND THE OCCASIONAL PHEASANT ...'
2521,John Cleese,Who wrote that?
2522,John Cleese,Ah yes* did you bring the um ... the specimen of your um ... and so on* and so on?
2523,John Cleese,Good* good.
2524,John Cleese,No* no* not really.
2525,John Cleese,No.
2526,John Cleese,Well* we do it to make sure that you're serious about wanting insurance* I mean* if you're not* you won't spend a couple of months filling up that enormous churn with mmm* so on and so on...
2527,John Cleese,Good Lord no. Throw it away.
2528,Michael Palin,And we've just heard that Her Majesty the Queen has just tuned into this programme and so she is now watching this royal sketch here in this royal set. The actor on the left is wearing the great grey suit of the BBC wardrobe department and the other actor is ... about to deliver the first great royal joke here this royal evening.
2529,Michael Palin,Over to the fight you can see the royal cameraman* and behind... Oh* we've just heard she's switched over. She's watching the 'News at Ten'.
2530,John Cleese,Get on parade! Come on! We haven't got all day* have we? Come on* come on* come on.
2531,John Cleese,Hurry up ... right! Now* I know some hospitals where you get the patients lying around in bed. Sleeping* resting* recuperating* convalescing. Well* that's not the way we do things here* right! No* you won't be loafing about in bed wasting the doctors' time. You - you horrible little cripple. What's the matter with you?
2532,Michael Palin,Fractured tibia* sergeant.
2533,John Cleese,Fractured tibia* sergeant'? 'Fractured tibia* sergeant'? Ooh. Proper little mummy's boy* aren't we? Well* I'll tell you something* my fine friend* if you fracture a tibia here you keep quiet about it! Look at him!
2534,John Cleese,He's broken both his arms and he don't go shouting about it* do he? No! 'Cos he's a man - he's a woman* you see* so don't come that broken tibia talk with me. Get on at the double. One* two* three* pick that crutch up* pick that crutch right up.
2535,Michael Palin,Aaargh!
2536,John Cleese,Right* squad* 'shun! Squad* right turn. Squad* by the left* quick limp! Come on* pick 'em up. Get some air in those wounds.
2537,Michael Palin,I've got a triple fracture of the right leg* dislocated collar bone and multiple head injuries* so I do most of the heavy work* like helping the surgeon.
2538,Michael Palin,Well* at the moment we're building him a holiday home.
2539,Michael Palin,Well* I don't know about them. They're not allowed to mix with the patients.
2540,Michael Palin,No* no* the ones that are really ill do sport.
2541,Michael Palin,Yes* one thing patients here dread are the runs.
2542,Michael Palin,But patients are allowed visiting. And this week they're visiting an iron foundry at Swindon* which is crying out for unskilled labour.
2543,Michael Palin,But this isn't the only hospital where doctors' conditions are improving.
2544,John Cleese,Well* here we try to help people who have to link sketches together. We try to stop them saying 'Have you ever wondered what it would be like if' and instead say something like um... er... 'And now the mountaineering sketch'.
2545,Michael Palin,Hello* Agnes... Agnes are you awake? Agnes....
2546,Michael Palin,Agnes...
2547,Michael Palin,Yeah... Agnes* where's Jane?
2548,Michael Palin,Jane* we're going down to raid the tuck shop.
2549,Michael Palin,Yeah* Joyce.
2550,Michael Palin,Cave girls... Here comes Miss Rodgers...
2551,John Cleese,Yes* on your screen tomorrow: 'The Naughtiest Girl in the School' starring the men of the 14th Marine Commandos.
2552,John Cleese,And now it's documentary time* when we look at the momentous last years of the Second World War* and tonight the invasion of Normandy performed by the girls of Oakdene High School* Upper Fifth Science.
2553,John Cleese,Coo-ee. Torpedo bay.
2554,Michael Palin,Yes* she said torpedo bay. She did* she did.
2555,John Cleese,Mrs Lieutenant Edale here. Mrs Midshipman Nesbitt's got one of her headaches again* so I put her in the torpedo tube.
2556,John Cleese,Kettle on.
2557,John Cleese,Standing by to feed the cat.
2558,Michael Palin,I'm afraid we are unable to show you any more of that letter. We continue with a man with a stoat through his head.
2559,Michael Palin,And now ...
2560,Michael Palin,Still no sign of land ... How long is it?
2561,Michael Palin,You stupid git. I meant how long we've been in the lifeboat. You've spoilt the atmosphere now.
2562,Michael Palin,Shut up! We'll have to start again ... Still no sign of land ... how long is it?
2563,Michael Palin,Thirty-three days?
2564,Michael Palin,Shut up!
2565,Michael Palin,Of course you did.
2566,Michael Palin,Look* shut up! SHUT UP! ... Still no sign of land ... how long is it?
2567,Michael Palin,Still no sign of land ... how long is it?
2568,Michael Palin,Shut up* Maudling. We've just got to keep hoping someone will find us.
2569,John Cleese,Not too good ... I ... feel ... so weak.
2570,John Cleese,Listen ... chaps ... there's one last chance. I'm done for* I've got a gammy leg* I'm going fast* I'll never get through ... but ... some of you might ... so you'd better eat me.
2571,Michael Palin,Eat you* sir?
2572,John Cleese,Yes. Eat me.
2573,John Cleese,You don't have to eat the leg* Thompson* there's still plenty of good meat ... look at that arm.
2574,John Cleese,What do you mean?
2575,John Cleese,Why don't you want to eat me?
2576,John Cleese,I see.
2577,Michael Palin,Well ... I ... er ...
2578,Michael Palin,No* no* you go ahead* I won't ...
2579,Michael Palin,No* no* it's not just that ...
2580,Michael Palin,Well* he's not kosher.
2581,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* I see that ... well to be quite frank* I like my meat a little more lean. I'd rather eat Hodges.
2582,John Cleese,I wish you'd all stop bickering and eat me.
2583,Michael Palin,Good thinking* Hodges.
2584,Michael Palin,Waitress!
2585,Michael Palin,We've decided now* we're going to have leg of Hodges ...
2586,John Cleese,Dear Sir* I am glad to hear that your studio audience disapproves of the last skit as strongly as I. As a naval officer I abhor the implication that the Royal Navy is a haven for cannibalism. It is well known that we have the problem relatively under control* and that it is the RAF who now suffer the largest casualties in this area. And what do you think the Argylls ate in Aden. Arabs? Yours etc. Captain B.J. Smethwick in a white wine sauce with shallots* mushrooms and garlic.
2587,John Cleese,Good Morning.
2588,John Cleese,Um* well* I wonder if you can help me. You see* my mother has just died.
2589,John Cleese,What?
2590,John Cleese,Dump her?
2591,John Cleese,Yes!
2592,John Cleese,Well* which do you recommend?
2593,John Cleese,Oh.
2594,John Cleese,I see. Well* she's definitely dead.
2595,John Cleese,She's in this sack.
2596,John Cleese,Yes* yes* she was.
2597,John Cleese,Er* excuse me* um* are you suggesting eating my mother?
2598,John Cleese,Well* I do feel a bit peckish.
2599,John Cleese,Can we have some parsnips?
2600,John Cleese,I really don't think I should.
2601,Michael Palin,I Eric ... um
2602,John Cleese,And now ...
2603,Michael Palin,It's ...
2604,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus!
2605,John Cleese,Well* I would have had to come in anyway.
2606,John Cleese,Oh thank you.
2607,John Cleese,Oh yes you did.
2608,Michael Palin,No* no* it was very interesting.
2609,Michael Palin,No* no* murder's much more fun.
2610,Michael Palin,Three cheers for the defendant. Hip. Hip.
2611,Michael Palin,Hip. Hip.
2612,John Cleese,Which nobody can deny.
2613,John Cleese,This little-known Icelandic saga* written by an unknown hand in the late thirteenth century* has remained undiscovered until today. Now it comes to your screens for the first time. Fresh from the leaves of Iceland's history. The terrible 'Njorl's Saga'.
2614,Michael Palin,It's not that terrible.
2615,John Cleese,No* I meant terribly violent.
2616,Michael Palin,Oh yeah* yeah.
2617,John Cleese,Well I'm afraid we're having a little trouble getting this very exciting Icelandic saga started. If any of you at home have any ideas about how to get this exciting saga started again here's the address to write to:
2618,Michael Palin,Help the Exciting Icelandic Saga* 18b MacNorten Buildings* Oban.
2619,John Cleese,Hello* well I was the third voice you heard just now. I'm sorry about that terrible mess.
2620,Michael Palin,Well it wasn't all that terrible.
2621,John Cleese,No* no* I meant terrible in the sense of unfortunate.
2622,Michael Palin,Oh.
2623,John Cleese,Anyway* our plea for assistance has been answered by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society who've given us some very useful information about the saga and so we carry on now with 'Njorl's Saga' with our thanks going* once again* to the North Maiden Icelandic Saga Society.
2624,Michael Palin,Welcome to North Malden.
2625,Michael Palin,Yes* everyone is welcome to North Malden* none more so than the businessmen and investors who shape our society of the future. Here at North Malden...
2626,John Cleese,Hello? Is that the North Malden Icelandic Society?
2627,Michael Palin,Yes* that's right.
2628,John Cleese,About this saga.
2629,Michael Palin,Oh yes* the Icelandic saga.
2630,John Cleese,Yes.
2631,Michael Palin,Good* isn't it.
2632,John Cleese,Well er* I don't know* but you promised us that you would stick to the spirit of the original text.
2633,John Cleese,Well I mean a lot of these things that are happening* well they just don't quite ring true.
2634,Michael Palin,Well* it's a new interpretation really.
2635,John Cleese,Well we don't want a new...
2636,John Cleese,... I mean we wanted the proper thing... I mean just look what's happening now.
2637,Michael Palin,Banners were a very important part of Icelandic lore* Mr Mills.
2638,John Cleese,No* no* I'm sorry I* I can't accept that* it's gone too far* I'm very sorry but we'll have to terminate the agreement. You're just trying to cash in on the BBC's exciting Icelandic saga.
2639,Michael Palin,That's business* Mr Mills.
2640,John Cleese,Well* that's as maybe but it's not the way the BBC works.
2641,Michael Palin,Well I'm sorry you feel that way but er* you know* if you ever want to come to Malden...
2642,John Cleese,Case dismissed* m'lud?
2643,John Cleese,Thank you* m'lud.
2644,John Cleese,Call Erik Njorl* son of Frothgar* brother of Hangnor...
2645,John Cleese,.
2646,John Cleese,Call Police Constable Pan-Am.
2647,John Cleese,Now* you are Police Constable Pan-Am?
2648,Michael Palin,No* I shall deny that to the last breath in my body.
2649,Michael Palin,Oh. Sorry* yes.
2650,John Cleese,Police constable* do you recognize the defendant?
2651,Michael Palin,No. Never seen him before in my life.
2652,John Cleese,Constable* will you please tell the court in your own words what happened?
2653,Michael Palin,Oh yes!
2654,Michael Palin,No* anyway I clearly saw the deceased...
2655,Michael Palin,Defendant! Sorry. Sorry* super. I clearly saw the defendant ... doing whatever he's accused of...Red-handed. When kicked... he said: 'It's a fair ... cop* I done it all ... Right... no doubt about... that'. Then* bound as he was to the chair* he assaulted myself and three other constables while bouncing around the cell. The end.
2656,Michael Palin,Thank you* thank you... and for my next piece of evidence...
2657,John Cleese,Excellent evidence* constable
2658,John Cleese,And now the Stock Market Report by Exchange Telegraph.
2659,John Cleese,Hello* Mrs Conclusion.
2660,John Cleese,Busy! I've just spent four hours burying the cat.
2661,John Cleese,Yes! It wouldn't keep still* wriggling about howling its head off.
2662,John Cleese,Well* no* no* but it's not at all a well cat so as we were going away for a fortnight's holiday* I thought I'd better bury it just to be on the safe side.
2663,John Cleese,Yes.
2664,John Cleese,Really? Is it very old?
2665,John Cleese,Tell me* how do they put budgies down then?
2666,John Cleese,Just there!
2667,John Cleese,Well well well. 'Course* Mrs Essence flushed hers down the loo.
2668,John Cleese,It's a funny thing freedom. I mean how can any of us be really free when we still have personal possessions.
2669,John Cleese,No* you can't. You can't. Well this is the whole crux of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Roads to Freedom'.
2670,John Cleese,What does he know?
2671,John Cleese,Sixty new pence for a bottle of Maltese Claret. Well I personally think Jean-Paul's masterwork is an allegory of man's search for commitment.
2672,John Cleese,Yes it is.
2673,John Cleese,Tis.
2674,John Cleese,All right. We can soon settle this. We'll ask him.
2675,John Cleese,Yes* we met on holiday last year.
2676,John Cleese,Yes. He was staying there with his wife and Mr and Mr Genet. Oh* I did get on well with Madam S. We were like that.
2677,John Cleese,Well* you know* a bit moody. Yes* he didn't join in the fun much. Just sat there thinking. Still* Mr Rotter caught him a few times with the whoopee cushion.
2678,John Cleese,Le Capitalisme et La Bourgeoisie ils sont la même chose... Oooh we did laugh.
2679,John Cleese,Yes* all right. She said they were in the book.
2680,John Cleese,Where's the Paris telephone directory?
2681,John Cleese,No* no* that's Budapest. Oh here we are Sartre ... Sartre.
2682,John Cleese,Oh* thank you* Mrs Varley.
2683,John Cleese,Well he's out distributing pamphlets to the masses but he'll be in at six.
2684,John Cleese,Oh look* Paris!
2685,John Cleese,Well it's none of my business but we had the same trouble with one of our Icelandic sagas. These people are terribly keen but they do rather tend to take over. I think I'd stick to Caribbean Islands if I were you.
2686,John Cleese,Fine... and now back to the saga.
2687,John Cleese,Here - this is not Paris* this is Iceland.
2688,John Cleese,Oh* here we are* Number 25 ....
2689,John Cleese,Flat 1* Duke and Duchess of Windsor* Flat 2* Yves Montand* Flat 3* Jacques Cousteau* Flat 4* Jean Genet and Friend* Flat 5* Maurice Laroux...
2690,John Cleese,Never heard of him. Flat 6* Marcel Marceau* 'Walking Against the Wind' Ltd. Flat 7* Indira Gandhi?
2691,John Cleese,Yes* Flat 8* Jean-Paul and Betty-Muriel Sartre.
2692,John Cleese,C'est nous* Betty-Muriel* excusez que nous sorerues en retard.
2693,John Cleese,Oui* merci.
2694,Michael Palin,Oh* rubbish.
2695,Michael Palin,Bonjour.
2696,Michael Palin,Oh yes. Good day.
2697,Michael Palin,Hello* love!
2698,John Cleese,Hello! Oh this is Mrs Conclusion from No. 46.
2699,Michael Palin,Nice to meet you* dear.
2700,John Cleese,How's the old man* then?
2701,Michael Palin,Oh* don't ask. He's in one of his bleeding moods. 'The bourgeoisie this is the bourgeoisie that' - he's like a little child sometimes. I was only telling the Rainiers the other day - course he's always rude to them* only classy friends we've got - I was saying solidarity with the masses I said... pie in the sky! Oooh! You're not a Marxist are you Mrs Conclusion?
2702,Michael Palin,Oh good. I mean* look at this place! I'm at my wits end. Revolutionary leaflets everywhere. One of these days I'll revolutionary leaflets him. If it wasn't for the goat you couldn't get in here for propaganda.
2703,John Cleese,Oh very well. Can we pop in and have a word with him?
2704,Michael Palin,Yes come along.
2705,John Cleese,Thank you.
2706,Michael Palin,But be careful. He's had a few. Mind you he's as good as gold in the morning* I've got to hand it to him* but come lunchtime it's a bottle of vin ordinaire - six glasses and he's ready to agitate.
2707,John Cleese,Coo-ee! Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul! It's only us. Oh pardon ... c'est même nous...
2708,John Cleese,Jean-Paul. Your famous trilogy 'Rues à Liberté* is it an allegory of man's search for commitment?
2709,John Cleese,I told you so.
2710,Michael Palin,They live in a sunshine paradise* a Caribbean dream* where only reality is missing.
2711,John Cleese,An island inhabited entirely by ex-international interviewers in pursuit of the impossible dream.
2712,Michael Palin,The light-weight suits.
2713,John Cleese,The practised voice of the seasoned campaigner.
2714,Michael Palin,You can't teach an old dog new tricks and so
2715,Michael Palin,you find them...
2716,John Cleese,... sipping Martinis...
2717,Michael Palin,Father Pierre* why did you stay on in this colonial Campari-land where the clink of glasses mingles with the murmur of a million mosquitoes* where waterfalls of whisky wash away the worries of a world-weary Whicker* where gin and tonic jingle in a gyroscopic jubilee of something beginning with J - Father Pierre* why did you stay on here?
2718,John Cleese,Well there you have it* a crumbling...
2719,Michael Palin,... like the music of repeat fees...
2720,John Cleese,... from Whicker Island...
2721,Michael Palin,... well and...
2722,John Cleese,. .. voy...
2723,Michael Palin,I'm convinced.
2724,Michael Palin,But how to prove it.
2725,Michael Palin,7.30 Fed cat.
2726,John Cleese,And now...
2727,Michael Palin,It's...
2728,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus.
2729,Michael Palin,Knock* enter and approach.
2730,Michael Palin,Right* it's come to my notice that certain boys have been running a unit-trust linked assurance scheme with fringe benefits and full cash-in endowment facilities. Apparently small investors were attracted by the wide-ranging portfolio and that in the first week the limited offer was oversubscribed eight times.
2731,Michael Palin,Shut up* Stebbins! I haven't finished. Oh* by the way* congratulations on winning the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.
2732,Michael Palin,Shut up. Now then* this sort of extra-curricular capitalist expansion has got to stop. I made it quite clear when Potter tried to go public last term* that these massive stock exchange deals must not happen in Big School. Is that clear* Balderston?
2733,Michael Palin,Oh* and Balderston* next time you do a 'Panorama' Report on the Black Ghettos you
2734,Michael Palin,get an exeat form from Mr Dibley.
2735,Michael Palin,Shut up* and stop slouching. Now* the reason I called you in here today* is that my wife is having a little trouble with her*.. er... with her waterworks* and I think she needs a bit of attention. Now* which one of you is the surgeon?
2736,Michael Palin,Ah! Tidwell. Good. Well* I want you to come along and have a look at the wife.
2737,Michael Palin,Is this true* Stebbins? Are you a gynaecologist?
2738,Michael Palin,Right* just the man. How much do you charge?
2739,Michael Palin,Excellent. Right. I want you to go along to see the wife. Give her a full examination* and let me know the results by the end of break. And don't pick your nose!
2740,John Cleese,Hello.
2741,John Cleese,Well* last week we showed you how to become a gynaecologist. And this week on 'How to do it' we're going to show you how to play the flute* how to split an atom* how to construct a box girder bridge* how to irrigate the Sahara Desert and make vast new areas of land cultivatable* but first* here's Jackie to tell you all how to rid the world of all known diseases.
2742,John Cleese,Hello* Jackie.
2743,John Cleese,Thanks* Jackie. Great idea. How to play the flute.
2744,John Cleese,Well here we are. You blow there and you move your fingers up and down here.
2745,John Cleese,Bye.
2746,Michael Palin,Oh* yes* he's such a clever little boy* just like his father.
2747,Michael Palin,Oh yes* spitting image.
2748,John Cleese,Good afternoon* mother. Good afternoon* Mrs Nigger-Baiter.
2749,Michael Palin,Ooh* he's walking already!
2750,Michael Palin,Hello* coochy coo...
2751,Michael Palin,Oochy coochy.
2752,Michael Palin,Look at him laughing... ooh* he's a chirpy little fellow. Isn't he a chirpy little fellow ... eh? eh? Does he talk Does he talk* eh?
2753,John Cleese,Of course I talk* I'm Minister for Overseas Development.
2754,Michael Palin,Ooh* he's a clever little boy - he's a clever little boy.
2755,Michael Palin,Do you like your rattle? Do you like your rattle? Look at his little eyes following it ... look at his iggy piggy piggy little eyeballs eh... oo... he's got a tubby tum-tum. Oh* he's got a tubby tum-tum.
2756,John Cleese,Mother* could I have a quick cup of tea please. I have an important statement on Rhodesia to make in the Commons at six.
2757,John Cleese,Good thing* too.
2758,John Cleese,Oh* mother* don't be so sentimental. Things explode every day.
2759,John Cleese,Peter Ilyich Tschaikowsky was born in 1840 in a Ken Russell film just outside St Petersburg. His father
2760,John Cleese,. In 1863* however* Tschaikowsky was sent to Moscow to study the piano and* when he'd finished that* the living room. Maurice takes up the story.
2761,Michael Palin,Well* guess what* the very next thing he did was to go to this extraordinary but
2762,Michael Palin,duckety-poos semi-Mondrian house in Robin Russia. Harry here Tammy Tschaikowsky wrote some of the most Sammy super symphonies you've ever Henry heard in the whole of your Lily life.
2763,Michael Palin,She was such a good composer that everybody* but everybody* wanted to know* and quite right too* because she wrote some lovely bits* such as Sally Sleeping Beauty* Patsy Pathétique* Adrian 1812 and lots of Conny concerti for Vera violin and Peter Piano Fanny Forte.
2764,John Cleese,But what do we really know of this tortured ponce?
2765,John Cleese,Maurice.
2766,Michael Palin,Me. Well* poor pet* she was like a lost lamb in an abattoir. Eventually she Dickie died of Colin Cholera in St Patsy Petersburg* in Gertie great Percy pain.
2767,Michael Palin,Terrific! Thrill to Thomas a Becket's Kierkegaardian moment of choice while making your physique tighter* firmer* neater.
2768,Michael Palin,Renew the obedience you have violated.
2769,John Cleese,Lose inches off your hips* thighs* buttocks and abdomen.
2770,Michael Palin,This was Kevin Francis before last season's 'Trim-Jean Play of the Month' production of 'The Seagull' by Anton Chekhov and the Sauna Belt Trim-Jean Company Limited. See Kevin has slipped into his slenderizing garment and is inflating it with the handy little pump provided. Three acts and a few special torso exercises later* Kevin* as Trigorin* the failed writer of sentimental romances* has lost over thirty-three inches.
2771,Michael Palin,Wow. What a difference. That Anton Chekhov can certainly write.
2772,Michael Palin,Terrific.
2773,Michael Palin,Enjoy the 'The Trim Gentlemen of Verona' and 'Long Day's Journey into Night' while inches melt away.
2774,John Cleese,And Red Indians!
2775,John Cleese,It was the only thing left.
2776,Michael Palin,Yes - that's a Flemish merchant of the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries...
2777,John Cleese,Yes* Gomez?
2778,John Cleese,You see the BBC has to pay an actor twenty guineas if he speaks and it makes a bit of a hole in the budget...
2779,John Cleese,You fool Gomez - that's twenty-eight guineas ...
2780,John Cleese,Are you supposed to speak?
2781,John Cleese,But you've just spoken!
2782,John Cleese,You fool* that's* that's fifty-six guineas before we've even started;
2783,John Cleese,What did he do that for?
2784,John Cleese,Look! We can't afford it! The BBC are short of money as it is.
2785,John Cleese,Stop! Stop this adaptation of 'Puss-in-Boots'! This is the Police Department of the State of Venezuela!
2786,John Cleese,Oh* yes it is!
2787,John Cleese,Shut up! Shut up!
2788,John Cleese,Now I'm going to ask you some questions* and remember* if you do not give me correct answers* we have ways of making you answer!
2789,John Cleese,Shut up! Now* what ship are you from?
2790,John Cleese,Go on!
2791,Michael Palin,What's this about doing the 'Horse of the Year Show' in here tonight?
2792,John Cleese,I'm sorry* Mrs Kelly. We don't know* I'm afraid - this is drama.
2793,Michael Palin,Mr Fox told me* before he went down to the pub* that they were doing 'Horse of the Year Show' in here tonight at 9.10.
2794,John Cleese,This is BBC 2
2795,Michael Palin,Well* I'm not having Harvey Smith jumping over my binette.
2796,John Cleese,All right!!
2797,Michael Palin,Right! That's it!
2798,Michael Palin,Come on now* out! All of you - get out of my kitchen* all of you - come on! Harvey Smith* get out of here!
2799,Michael Palin,That's what
2800,Michael Palin,think* Mr Fox!
2801,Michael Palin,Shove off! Go and find yourself another flat! Get out!
2802,Michael Palin,Hello* good evening* welcome. It's...
2803,Michael Palin,It's...
2804,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circuses.
2805,Michael Palin,I bling a dispatch flom Prymouth.
2806,Michael Palin,Flow Sil Flancis Dlake.
2807,Michael Palin,Dlake has sighted the Spanish Freet* youl Majesty.
2808,Michael Palin,One hundled and thilty-six men of wal.
2809,Michael Palin,He has oldeled the whore freet into the Blitish Channer.
2810,John Cleese,Not so fast* Yakomoto.
2811,John Cleese,Allow me to introduce myself. I am Inspector Leopard of Scotland Yard* Special Fraud Film Director Squad.
2812,John Cleese,The same. Only more violent.
2813,John Cleese,I haven't got time to go chasing after him* there's violence to be done.
2814,Michael Palin,Yus?
2815,Michael Palin,Suffragan or diocesan?
2816,Michael Palin,It's tatooed on the back of their neck. Ere! Is that rat tart?
2817,Michael Palin,Disgusting! Right! The hunt is on.
2818,Michael Palin,Oh Lord we beseech thee tell us who croaked Leicester.
2819,Michael Palin,Agreed.
2820,Michael Palin,Right. And now* I'd like to conclude this arrest with a hymn.
2821,John Cleese,What a simply super little place!
2822,Michael Palin,Hello* Mr Spare-Buttons-Supplied-With-The-Shirt. Nice to see you again.
2823,Michael Palin,May I recommend the alligator purees.
2824,Michael Palin,Now then* have you decided?
2825,Michael Palin,Right* so that's two avocado* one quiche ...
2826,Michael Palin,So* that's two avocado* one quiche ...
2827,Michael Palin,Right.
2828,Michael Palin,And to follow?
2829,John Cleese,And one scampi desirée.
2830,Michael Palin,Right on. Two chicken! One scampi! One boeuf with green salad!
2831,Michael Palin,There may be ... a little delay.
2832,Michael Palin,Yes* sir. Yes* we'll try.
2833,John Cleese,Yes* I thought most places took Barclaycard nowadays.
2834,John Cleese,The London Brick Company?
2835,John Cleese,The forbidden plateau of Roiurama* the Lost World* thrown up by mighty earth movements thousands of millions of years ago* where strange primeval creatures defying evolution* lurk in the dark* impenetrable forests* cut off forever from the outside world.
2836,Michael Palin,What page please?
2837,Michael Palin,What page in the script?
2838,Michael Palin,Come on you dogs* we have time to lose* this has gone too far.
2839,Michael Palin,Er ... um ... er...
2840,Michael Palin,The Lost World of Roiurama'.
2841,Michael Palin,Oh* sorry. 'Where were they going* sir'?
2842,Michael Palin,Yes sir* we've got a telegram.
2843,Michael Palin,Reads it. Expedition superb. Weather excellent. Everything wonderful.
2844,Michael Palin,For God's sake be careful...
2845,Michael Palin,For God's sake be careful* sir.
2846,John Cleese,Goodbye Betty* Goodbye Farquarson. Goodbye Brian. It's been a great expedition...
2847,John Cleese,Great expedition ...
2848,John Cleese,Wait a moment!
2849,John Cleese,If we're on film* there must be someone filming us.
2850,John Cleese,What a stroke of luck!
2851,John Cleese,Wait a minute!
2852,John Cleese,If this is the crew who were filming us . .. who's filming us now? Look!
2853,Michael Palin,I'd like to have an argument please.
2854,Michael Palin,No* this is my first time.
2855,Michael Palin,Well* what would be the cost?
2856,Michael Palin,Well* I think it's probably best if I start with the one and see how it goes from there. OK?
2857,Michael Palin,Thank you.
2858,Michael Palin,Well I was told outside ...
2859,Michael Palin,What!
2860,Michael Palin,Look! I came here for an argument.
2861,Michael Palin,Oh I see* that explains it.
2862,Michael Palin,I see - sorry.
2863,John Cleese,Come in.
2864,Michael Palin,Is this the right room for an argument?
2865,John Cleese,I've told you once.
2866,Michael Palin,No you haven't.
2867,John Cleese,Yes I have.
2868,Michael Palin,When?
2869,John Cleese,Just now!
2870,Michael Palin,No you didn't.
2871,John Cleese,Yes I did!
2872,Michael Palin,Didn't.
2873,John Cleese,Did.
2874,John Cleese,I'm telling you I did!
2875,Michael Palin,You did not!
2876,John Cleese,I'm sorry* is this a five minute argument* or the full half hour?
2877,Michael Palin,Oh ... Just a five-minute one.
2878,John Cleese,Fine
2879,John Cleese,thank you. Anyway* I did.
2880,Michael Palin,You most certainly did not.
2881,John Cleese,Now* let's get one thing quite clear. I most definitely told you!
2882,Michael Palin,You did not.
2883,John Cleese,Yes I did.
2884,John Cleese,Yes I did!!
2885,Michael Palin,Look* this isn't an argument.
2886,John Cleese,Yes it is.
2887,Michael Palin,No it isn't* it's just contradiction.
2888,John Cleese,No it isn't.
2889,Michael Palin,Yes it is.
2890,John Cleese,It is not.
2891,Michael Palin,It is. You just contradicted me.
2892,John Cleese,No I didn't.
2893,Michael Palin,Ooh* you did!
2894,John Cleese,No* no* no* no* no.
2895,Michael Palin,You did* just then.
2896,John Cleese,No* nonsense!
2897,Michael Palin,Oh* look this is futile.
2898,Michael Palin,I came here for a good argument.
2899,John Cleese,No you didn't* you came here for an argument.
2900,Michael Palin,Well* an argument's not the same as contradiction.
2901,John Cleese,It can be.
2902,Michael Palin,No it can't. An argument is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.
2903,Michael Palin,Yes it is. It isn't just contradiction.
2904,John Cleese,Look* if I argue with you* I must take up a contrary position.
2905,Michael Palin,But it isn't just saying 'No it isn't'.
2906,Michael Palin,No it isn't* Argument is an intellectual process ... contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.
2907,John Cleese,Not at all.
2908,Michael Palin,Now look!
2909,John Cleese,That's it. Good morning.
2910,Michael Palin,But I was just getting interested.
2911,John Cleese,Sorry the five minutes is up.
2912,Michael Palin,That was never five minutes just now!
2913,John Cleese,I'm afraid it was.
2914,Michael Palin,No it wasn't.
2915,John Cleese,I'm sorry* I'm not allowed to argue any more.
2916,Michael Palin,What!?
2917,John Cleese,If you want me to go on arguing you'll have to pay for another five minutes.
2918,Michael Palin,But that was never five minutes just now ... oh Come on!
2919,Michael Palin,This is ridiculous.
2920,John Cleese,I'm very sorry* but I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid.
2921,Michael Palin,Oh. all right.
2922,Michael Palin,There you are.
2923,John Cleese,Thank you.
2924,Michael Palin,Well?.
2925,John Cleese,Well what?
2926,Michael Palin,That was never five minutes just now.
2927,John Cleese,I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid!
2928,Michael Palin,I've just paid.
2929,John Cleese,No you didn't.
2930,Michael Palin,I did! I did! I did!
2931,Michael Palin,Look I don't want to argue about that.
2932,John Cleese,Well I'm very sorry but you didn't pay.
2933,Michael Palin,Aha! Well if I didn't pay* why are you arguing ... got you!
2934,John Cleese,No you haven't.
2935,Michael Palin,Yes I have ... if you're arguing I must have paid.
2936,John Cleese,Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time.
2937,Michael Palin,I've had enough of this.
2938,Michael Palin,Oh shut up!
2939,Michael Palin,I want to complain.
2940,Michael Palin,No* I want to complain about ...
2941,Michael Palin,Ooh!
2942,Michael Palin,Waaghh!
2943,Michael Palin,No!
2944,Michael Palin,Waagh!
2945,Michael Palin,Stop hitting me!
2946,Michael Palin,Stop hitting me.
2947,Michael Palin,Yes.
2948,Michael Palin,I came here to complain.
2949,Michael Palin,What a stupid concept.
2950,Michael Palin,Ooooh?
2951,Michael Palin,What for?
2952,Michael Palin,The what?
2953,Michael Palin,WAAAGH!
2954,Michael Palin,Rotten.
2955,John Cleese,Hold it.
2956,Michael Palin,Hello* good evening and welcome to another edition of Blood* Devastation* Death War and Horror* and later on we'll be meeting a man who does gardening.  But first on the show we've got a man who speaks entirely in anagrams.
2957,Michael Palin,Do you enjoy it?
2958,Michael Palin,And what's your name?
2959,Michael Palin,Well* Graham* nice to have you on the show.  Now* where do you come from?
2960,Michael Palin,Cumberland?
2961,Michael Palin,And I believe you're working on an anagram version of Shakespeare?
2962,Michael Palin,The Mating of the Wersh'?  By William Shakespeare?
2963,Michael Palin,And what else?
2964,Michael Palin,Have you done 'Hamlet'?
2965,Michael Palin,And what is your next project?
2966,Michael Palin,I'm sorry?
2967,Michael Palin,Ah* Ring Kichard* yes...  but surely that's not an anagram* that's a spoonerism.
2968,John Cleese,And now...
2969,Michael Palin,It's...
2970,John Cleese,Tony M. Nyphot's Flying Risccu.
2971,John Cleese,Mrs Scab* you have twelve hours to beat the clock.
2972,John Cleese,Correct!
2973,John Cleese,Hello? Ah* Mr Victim* I'm glad to say that I've got the go-ahead to lend you the money you require. Yes* of course we will want as security the deeds of your house* of your aunt's house* of your second cousin's house* of your wife's parents' house* and of your grannie's bungalow* and we will in addition need a controlling interest in your new company* unrestricted access to your private bank account* the deposit in our vaults of your three children as hostages and a full legal indemnity against any acts of embezzlement carried out against you by any members of our staff during the normal course of their duties... no* I'm afraid we couldn't accept your dog instead of your youngest child* we would like to suggest a brand new scheme of ours under which 51% of both your dog and your wife pass to us in the event of your suffering a serious accident. Fine. No* not at all* nice to do business with you.
2974,John Cleese,Ah* Mr Ford isn't it?
2975,John Cleese,How do you do. I'm a merchant banker.
2976,John Cleese,Er... I forget my name for the moment but I am a merchant banker.
2977,John Cleese,Well I don't want to show my hand too early* but actually here at Slater Nazi we are quite keen to get into orphans* you know* developing market and all that... what sort of sum did you have in mind?
2978,John Cleese,Yes* I am. Yes. Yes* very very rich. Quite phenomenally wealthy. Yes* I do own the most startling quantifies of cash. Yes* quite right... you're rather a smart young lad aren't you. We could do with somebody like you to feed the pantomime horse. Very smart.
2979,John Cleese,Now* you were saying. I'm very* very* very* very* very* very* very* very* very* very* very rich.
2980,John Cleese,A pound. Yes* I see. Now this loan would be secured by the...
2981,John Cleese,What?
2982,John Cleese,Ah.
2983,John Cleese,It's a bit small for a share certificate isn't it? Look* I think I'd better run this over to our legal department. If you could possibly pop back on Friday...
2984,John Cleese,Yes* but you see I don't know what it's for.
2985,John Cleese,Yes?
2986,John Cleese,A what?
2987,John Cleese,Oh a gift!
2988,John Cleese,A tax dodge.
2989,John Cleese,No? Well* I'm awfully sorry I don't understand. Can you just explain exactly what you want.
2990,John Cleese,No* no* no* I don't follow this at all* I mean* I don't want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I'm a pound down on the whole deal.
2991,John Cleese,I am! Well* what is my incentive to give you the pound?
2992,John Cleese,Happy?... You quite sure you've got this right?
2993,John Cleese,What* just like that?
2994,John Cleese,Must be sick. I don't suppose you could give me a list of their names and addresses could you?
2995,John Cleese,Good lord! That's the most exciting new idea I've heard in years! It's so simple it's brilliant! Well* if that idea of yours isn't worth a pound I'd like to know what is.
2996,John Cleese,The only trouble is* you gave me the idea before I'd given you the pound. And that's not good business.
2997,John Cleese,No* I'm afraid it isn't. So* um* off you go.
2998,John Cleese,Nice to do business with you.
2999,Michael Palin,Anyway.
3000,John Cleese,And off we go again.
3001,John Cleese,Ah Miss Godfrey could yould send in the pantomime horses please.
3002,John Cleese,Now I've asked you to ...
3003,John Cleese,No* I'm afraid there's no redundancy scheme.
3004,John Cleese,Pang! Right in the toast. A brief struggle and all is over. Poor breakfast! Another victim of the.... aargh!
3005,John Cleese,Sketch just starting* actor wanted.
3006,Michael Palin,Come in* Mr Horton.
3007,Michael Palin,Do - do sit down.
3008,Michael Palin,Now then Horton* you've been with us for twenty years* and your work in the accounts department has been immaculate
3009,Michael Palin,... has undermined the competence of this firm to such a point that I'm afraid that I've got no option but to sack you.
3010,Michael Palin,Good evening. Well tonight* we are going to talk about... well that is... I am going to talk about... well actually I am talking about it now... well I'm not talking about it now* but I am talking... I know I'm pausing occasionally* and not talking during the pauses* but the pauses are part of the whole process of talking... when one talks one has to pause... er ... like then! I paused ... but I was still talking ... and again there! No the real point of what I'm saying is that when I appear not to be talking don't go nipping out to the kitchen* putting the kettle on ... buttering scones... or getting crumbs and bits of food out of those round brown straw mats that the teapot goes on... because in all probability I'm still talking and what you heard was a pause ... er ... like there again. Look! To make it absolutely easier* so there's no problem at all* what I'll do* I'll give you some kind of sign* like this
3011,Michael Palin,All right?
3012,Michael Palin,No* no! No sorry - just demonstrating... haven't finished. Haven't started yet.
3013,Michael Palin,Tonight I want to talk about...
3014,Michael Palin,... with a large piece of wet paper.
3015,John Cleese,Good evening* I'm the announcer who's just been given this job by the BBC and I'd just like to say how grateful I am to the BBC for providing me with work* particularly at this time of year* when things are a bit thin for us announcers... um... I don't know whether I should tell you this* but* well* I have been going through a rather tough time recently. Things have been pretty awful at home. My wife* Josephine... 'Joe-jums' as I call her ... who is also an announcer...
3016,John Cleese,... has not been able to announce since our youngest* Clifford* was born* and* well*
3017,Michael Palin,Hello* I'm another announcer* my name's Dick. Joe-jums just rang me and said Jack was having a bad time with this announcement* so I've just come to give him a hand. How is he* Joe-jums?
3018,Michael Palin,Jack... it's Dick... Do you want me to make the announcement?
3019,John Cleese,No* no Dick. I must do it myself...
3020,John Cleese,it's my last chance with the BBC* I can't throw it away... I've got to do it ... for Joe-jums... for the kids... I've got to go through with it...
3021,Michael Palin,Good man. Now remember your announcer's training: deep breaths* and try not to think about what you're saying...
3022,John Cleese,Good evening. This
3023,John Cleese,is BBC 1...
3024,Michael Palin,Keep going* old boy.
3025,John Cleese,It's... nine o'clock... and... time... for... the News... read by... Richard Baker.
3026,Michael Palin,Congratulations* old man!
3027,John Cleese,Thank God.
3028,Michael Palin,... have a drink. For God's sake drink this...
3029,John Cleese,Fantastic.
3030,Michael Palin,The least I could do - super - I must come over.
3031,John Cleese,I can't tell you how much that means.
3032,John Cleese,And now the English pantomime horse has very nearly caught up with the Russian pantomime horse* I think he's going to take him any moment now but what is this? What is this?
3033,John Cleese,My goodness me it's the Duke of Kent to the rescue...
3034,John Cleese,Here you see some English comic actors engaged in a life or death struggle with a rather weak ending. This is typical of the zany madcap world of the irresistible kooky funsters. The English pantomime horse wins and so is assured of a place in British history and a steady job in a merchant bank. Unfortunately* before his pension rights are assured* he catches bronchitis and dies* another victim of the need to finish these shows on time.
3035,John Cleese,And now...
3036,Michael Palin,It's...
3037,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circuses...
3038,Michael Palin,Er* well* Swann* Swann* there's this house* there's this house* and er* it's in the morning* it's in the morning - no* it's the evening* in the evening and er* there's a garden and er* this bloke comes in - bloke comes in - what's his name - what's his name* er just said it - big bloke - Swann* Swann
3039,Michael Palin,Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. The mountain with the biggest tits in the world.
3040,Michael Palin,Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. This year* this remote Himalayan mountain* this mystical temple* surrounded by the most difficult terrain in the world* repulsed yet another attempt to conquer it. This time* by the International Hairdresser's Expedition.
3041,Michael Palin,In such freezing* adverse conditions* man comes very close to breaking point. What was the real cause of the disharmony which destroyed their chances at success?
3042,Michael Palin,Well* people would keep taking my hairdryer and never returning it.
3043,Michael Palin,The leader of the expedition was Colonel Sir John 'Teasy-Weasy' Butler* veteran of K2* Annapurna* and Vidals. His plan was to ignore the usual route around the South Col and to make straight for the top.
3044,Michael Palin,Could it work? Could this eighteen-year old hairdresser from Brixton succeed where others had failed? The situation was complicated by the imminent arrival of the monsoon storms. Patrice takes up the story.
3045,Michael Palin,After a blazing row* the Germans and Italians had turned back* taking with them the last of the hair nets. On the third day a blizzard blew up.
3046,Michael Palin,Temperatures fell to minus thirty centigrade. Inside the little tent* things were getting desperate.
3047,Michael Palin,Well* things have got so bad that we've been forced to use the last of the heavy oxygen equipment just to keep the dryers going.
3048,Michael Palin,Oh* she's a treas.
3049,Michael Palin,But a new factor had entered the race. A team of French chiropodists* working with brand new cornplasters and Doctor Scholl's Mountaineering Sandals* were covering ground fast. The Glasgow Orpheus Male Voice Choir were tackling the difficult North Col.
3050,Michael Palin,were at his heels. This was it. Ricky had to make a decision.
3051,Michael Palin,It was a tremendous success.
3052,Michael Palin,No* sorry* wrong number.
3053,Michael Palin,No* no* you put them in separately when the vine leaves are ready.
3054,John Cleese,Here* let me try* dear. You go and play the cello.
3055,John Cleese,Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or not?

3061,John Cleese,What... How did he... ?
3062,John Cleese,Right* you hang on. I must go and see him.
3063,John Cleese,I'm going upstairs* I can't bear it.
3064,John Cleese,Damn.
3065,John Cleese,No! They'd be useless!
3066,John Cleese,Hello* Eamonn.
3067,John Cleese,How was Dublin?
3068,John Cleese,Size seven. Yes* yes* yes* yes* yes .... it's the fire brigade* they want to know if they can come round Thursday evening.
3069,Michael Palin,And so it was the fire brigade eventually came round on Friday night.
3070,Michael Palin,Well I'll go* I'll go to the foot of our stairs. Ee ecky thump. Put wood in 'ole* muther.
3071,Michael Palin,Yes?
3072,Michael Palin,Ee ecky thump.
3073,Michael Palin,Ee ecky thump!
3074,Michael Palin,Thank you* sir.
3075,Michael Palin,Can you smell gas or is it me?
3076,John Cleese,Looks jolly good.
3077,John Cleese,Superb.
3078,John Cleese,Well* er* really something to make me a little less insignificant?
3079,John Cleese,Oh no* no* no* not really no.
3080,John Cleese,Oh no* I really want something that will make people be attracted to me like a magnet.
3081,John Cleese,What's that?
3082,John Cleese,Fantastic* yes.
3083,Michael Palin,Mount Everest* forbidding* aloof* terrifyring. The highest place on earth. No I'm sorry we don't go there. No.
3084,Michael Palin,Ah good morning. I'm Bounder of Adventure.
3085,Michael Palin,What?
3086,Michael Palin,Well you'd better cut down a little then.
3087,Michael Palin,You'd better cut down a little then.
3088,Michael Palin,Yes* he he...I expect you get people making jokes about your name all the time* eh?
3089,Michael Palin,Anyway* you're interested in one of our adventure holidays* eh?
3090,Michael Palin,The what?
3091,Michael Palin,The colour supplement?
3092,Michael Palin,C?
3093,Michael Palin,A cat?
3094,Michael Palin,Can you say the letter 'K'?
3095,Michael Palin,Why don't you say the letter 'K' instead of the letter 'C'?
3096,Michael Palin,Yes.
3097,Michael Palin,Anyway* about the holiday..
3098,Michael Palin,Ah good.
3099,Michael Palin,Yes. Absolutely* yes* I quite agree...
3100,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* now...
3101,Michael Palin,Will you be quiet please.
3102,Michael Palin,Shut up.
3103,Michael Palin,Shut up!
3104,Michael Palin,Shut up!!!
3105,Michael Palin,Shut your bloody gob! I've had enough of this* I'm going to ring the police.
3106,Michael Palin,Hello operator* operator...I'm trying to get the police...the police yes* what?
3107,Michael Palin,nine and a half* nine and a half* yes* yes...I see...well can you keep trying please...
3108,John Cleese,Miss.
3109,John Cleese,Can I just say here Chris for one moment that I have a new theory about the brontosaurus.
3110,John Cleese,Where?
3111,John Cleese,Oh* what is my theory?
3112,John Cleese,Oh what is my theory that it is. Yes* well you may well ask me what is my theory.
3113,John Cleese,Good for you. My word yes. Well Chris* what is it that it is - this theory of mine. Well* this is what it is - my theory that I have* that is to say* which is mine* is mine.
3114,John Cleese,Where? Oh* what is my theory? This is it.
3115,John Cleese,This is how it goes. The next thing I'm going to say is my theory. Ready?
3116,John Cleese,My Theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss* brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end* much much thicker in the middle* and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory* it is mine* and belongs to me and I own it* and what it is too.
3117,John Cleese,Spot on* Chris.
3118,John Cleese,And it's mine.
3119,John Cleese,My pleasure* Chris...
3120,John Cleese,It's been a lot of fun.
3121,John Cleese,Saying what my theory is.
3122,John Cleese,And whose it is.
3123,John Cleese,I have another theory.
3124,John Cleese,Called my second theory* or my theory number two.
3125,John Cleese,This second theory which was the one that I had said...
3126,John Cleese,Which I could expound without doubt. This second theory which* with the one which I have said* forms the brace of theories which I own and which belongs to me* goes like this...
3127,John Cleese,This is what it is.
3128,John Cleese,This is it...
3129,Michael Palin,Hello* yes***yes***
3130,Michael Palin,Hello! No* no* no I think they are all part of the British Shoe Corporation now.
3131,John Cleese,Chris* this other theory of mine which is mine like the other one I also own. The second theory...
3132,John Cleese,My second theory states that fire brigade choirs seldom sing songs about Marcel Proust.
3133,John Cleese,And now...
3134,Michael Palin,It's...
3135,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus.
3136,Michael Palin,Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR!
3137,Michael Palin,Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR! DOCTOR! Doctor! Doctor! Where is the Doctor?
3138,John Cleese,Hello!
3139,Michael Palin,Are you the brain specialist?
3140,John Cleese,No* no* I am not the brain specialist. No* no* I am not... Yes. Yes I am.
3141,Michael Palin,My brain hurts!
3142,John Cleese,Well let's take a look at it* Mr Gumby.
3143,Michael Palin,No* no* no* my brain in my head.
3144,John Cleese,It will have to come out.
3145,Michael Palin,Out? Of my head?
3146,John Cleese,Yes! All the bits of it. Nurse! Nurse!
3147,John Cleese,NURSE! NURSE! Nurse* take Mr Gumby to a brain surgeon.
3148,John Cleese,Where's the 'Lancet'?
3149,John Cleese,Where's the bloody 'Lancet'? My brain hurts too.
3150,Michael Palin,Hello!
3151,Michael Palin,Hullo fans. Begorra an' to be sure there's some fine badminton down there in Essex this afternoon. We really...
3152,John Cleese,Good evening. Tonight molluscs. The mollusc is a soft-bodied* unsegmented invertebrate animal usually protected by a large shell. One of the most numerous groups of invertebrates* it is exceeded in number of species only by the arthropods ... viz.
3153,John Cleese,What?
3154,John Cleese,Oh. Anyway* the typical mollusc* viz* a snail
3155,John Cleese,consists of a prominent muscular portion... the head-foot... a visceral mass and a shell which is secreted by the free edge of the mantle.
3156,John Cleese,Oh. Well anyway... in some molluscs* however* viz* slugs*
3157,John Cleese,the shell is absent or rudimentary...
3158,John Cleese,Whereas in others* viz* cephalopods the head-foot is greatly modified and forms tentacles* viz* the squid.
3159,John Cleese,What are you doing?
3160,John Cleese,Why* don't you like it?
3161,John Cleese,Is it?
3162,John Cleese,Well ... it's not much of a subject is it... be fair.
3163,John Cleese,Anyway the majority of the molluscs are included in three large groups* the gastropods* the lamellibranchs and the cephalopods...
3164,John Cleese,However* what is more interesting* er ... is the molluscs's er ... sex life.
3165,John Cleese,Yes* the mollusc is a randy little fellow whose primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know what.
3166,John Cleese,The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This hot-blooded little beast with its tent-like shell is always on the job. Its extra-marital activities are something startling. Frankly I don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the rock-face. How am I doing?
3167,John Cleese,Another loose-living gastropod is the periwinkle. This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral locomotion ... is
3168,John Cleese,the marrying kind: 'Anywhere anytime' is its motto. Up with the shell and they're at it.
3169,John Cleese,I'm coming to them ... the great scallop
3170,John Cleese,This latter is a right whore* a harlot* a trollop* a cynical bed-hopping firm-breasted Rabelaisian bit of sea food that makes Fanny Hill look like a dead Pope... and finally among the lamellibranch bivalves* that most depraved of the whole sub-species - the whelk. The whelk is nothing but a homosexual of the worst kind. This gay boy of the gastropods* this queer crustacean* this mincing mollusc* this screaming* prancing* limp-wristed queen of the deep makes me sick.
3171,John Cleese,Here!
3172,John Cleese,Oh* not at all. Thank you.
3173,John Cleese,Thank you.
3174,Michael Palin,The Minister for not listening to people toured Batley today to investigate allegations of victimization in home-loan improvement grants* made last week
3175,Michael Palin,broke down the door to the serving hatch* painted the spare room and next weekend I think they'll be able to make a start on the boy's bedroom* while Amy and Roger* up in London for a few days* go to see the mysterious Mr Grenville.
3176,Michael Palin,He in turn has been revealed by D'Arcy as something less than an honest man. Sybil feels once again a resurgence of her old affection and she and Balreau return to her little house in Clermont-Ferrand* the kind of two-up* two-down house that most French workers throughout the European Community are living in today.
3177,John Cleese,Hello. All the activity you can see in progress here is part of the intricate... aah!
3178,John Cleese,Sir Jane* what is the purpose of your expedition?
3179,Michael Palin,Well this is a completely uncharted lake with like hitherto unclassified marine life man* so the whole scene's wide open for a scientific exploration.
3180,John Cleese,One can see the immense amount of preparation involved. Have there been many difficulties in setting up this venture?
3181,Michael Palin,Well the real hang-up was with the bread man but when the top brass pigs came through we got it together in a couple of moons. Commodore Betty Grable* who's a real sub-aqua head* has got it together diving wise and like the whole gig's been a real gas man.
3182,John Cleese,Lieutenant Commander Dorothy Lamour.
3183,John Cleese,Dorothy you're in charge of security and liason for this operation.
3184,John Cleese,You've kept this all rather hush-hush so far shipmate.
3185,John Cleese,Argh! A tranquillizing dart fired by the cowardly BBC health department dogs ... they've done filled me full of chlorpromazine damn!
3186,Michael Palin,The navy's out of sight man come together with the RN it's really something other than else.
3187,Michael Palin,Hello?
3188,Michael Palin,There's a Mr Padgett.
3189,Michael Palin,There's no lake here* mate. This is Runcorn Avenue. What's the camera doing?
3190,Michael Palin,He's looking for a lake.
3191,John Cleese,Ooooh. I think it's someone about the damp.
3192,John Cleese,I'll go
3193,John Cleese,Yes?
3194,John Cleese,Well* I don't know about that* but it's bleeding damp. Are you from the council?
3195,John Cleese,Hang on.
3196,John Cleese,Get in.
3197,John Cleese,The Magna Carta - was it a document signed at Runnymede in 1215 by King John pledging independence to the English barons* or was it a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in Dorset? The latter idea is the brainchild of a man new to the field of historical research. Mr Badger* why - why are you on this programme?
3198,John Cleese,But why Dorset?
3199,John Cleese,Mr Badger* I think you're the silliest person we've ever had on this programme* and so I'm going to ask you to have dinner with me.
3200,John Cleese,Do please go on. This is the least fascinating conversation I've ever had.
3201,Michael Palin,Would you like to order sir?
3202,John Cleese,Yes* Mr Badger* what would you like to start with?
3203,Michael Palin,For first course* sir?
3204,Michael Palin,And for main course* sir?
3205,Michael Palin,Yes sir* and what would you like with it* sir? A whisky?
3206,Michael Palin,Fine* sir* he said between clenched teeth knowing full well it was a most unrewarding part.
3207,John Cleese,This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in.
3208,John Cleese,Yeah* all right.
3209,John Cleese,And now...
3210,Michael Palin,It's...
3211,John Cleese,Monty Python's Flying Circus.
3212,John Cleese,The Adventures of Biggles. Part one - Biggles dictates a letter.
3213,Michael Palin,Right ho.
3214,Michael Palin,What ho everyone.
3215,Michael Palin,I should bally well say so* old fruit.
3216,John Cleese,Next week part two - 'Biggles Flies Undone'.
3217,John Cleese,Meanwhile not very far away.
3218,Michael Palin,Climbing. The world's loneliest sport* where hardship and philosophy go hand in glove. And here* another British expedition* attempting to be the first man to successfully climb the north face of the Uxbridge Road.
3219,Michael Palin,This four-man rope has been climbing tremendously. BBC cameras were there to film every inch.
3220,John Cleese,Bert. How's it going?
3221,John Cleese,Bert* some people say this is crazy.
3222,John Cleese,Crippen
3223,John Cleese,crazy.
3224,Michael Palin,Lemon curry?
3225,John Cleese,Such quiet courage is typical of the way these brave chaps shrug off danger. Like it or not* you've got to admire the skill that goes into it.
3226,Michael Palin,Oh it's terrible up on deck.
3227,Michael Palin,Yes on deck. It's diabolical weather.
3228,Michael Palin,The deck* The deck of the lifeboat.
3229,Michael Palin,This is the Newhaven Lifeboat.
3230,Michael Palin,You're right. This isn't a lifeboat at all.
3231,Michael Palin,Do you mind if I sit down for a minute and collect my wits?
3232,Michael Palin,Thanks very much.
3233,Michael Palin,It's not a lifeboat* Frank.
3234,Michael Palin,It's not a lifeboat. It's this lady's house.
3235,John Cleese,It's a man outside Number 24.
3236,John Cleese,I can't. I've got that fixed on the Baileys at Number 13. Their new lodger moves in today.
3237,John Cleese,All right* bring her up on two. What's the duration reading on the oscillator?
3238,John Cleese,Well that's a long time for someone who's just had a routine checkup.
3239,John Cleese,Zoom in on the 16mm and hold her* Enid.
3240,John Cleese,I'll try and get her on the twelve-inch.
3241,John Cleese,Thank you* love.
3242,Michael Palin,Yes* it's one of those new self-righting models. Newhaven was about the first place in the country to get one.
3243,Michael Palin,Oh it's about 140-150 per square inch.
3244,John Cleese,Here we are* five for them and five for HMS
3245,John Cleese,.
3246,Michael Palin,HMS
3247,Michael Palin,? Two set teas please.
3248,Michael Palin,By the way* do you do lunches?
3249,Michael Palin,Right ho.
3250,Michael Palin,Lemon curry?
3251,Michael Palin,Good morning* sir.
3252,John Cleese,Good Morning. I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now* skimming through 'Rogue Herries' by Horace Walpole* when suddenly I came over all peckish.
3253,Michael Palin,Peckish* sir?
3254,John Cleese,Esurient.
3255,Michael Palin,Eh?
3256,John Cleese,Eee I were all hungry* like!
3257,Michael Palin,Oh* hungry.
3258,Michael Palin,Come again.
3259,John Cleese,I want to buy some cheese.
3260,Michael Palin,Oh* I thought you were complaining about the music!
3261,John Cleese,Heaven forbid. I am one who delights in all manifestations of the terpsichorean muse.
3262,Michael Palin,Sorry?
3263,John Cleese,I like a nice dance - you're forced to.
3264,Michael Palin,Anyway.
3265,Michael Palin,Who said that?
3266,John Cleese,Now my good man* some cheese* please.
3267,Michael Palin,Yes certainly* sir. What would you like?
3268,John Cleese,Well* how about a little Red Leicester.
3269,Michael Palin,I'm* afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester* sir.
3270,John Cleese,Oh* never mind. How are you on Tilsit?
3271,Michael Palin,Never at the end of the week* sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday.
3272,John Cleese,Tish tish. No matter. Well* four ounces of Caerphilly* then* if you please* stout yeoman.
3273,Michael Palin,Ah well* it's been on order for two weeks* sir* I was expecting it this morning.
3274,John Cleese,Yes* it's not my day* is it? Er* Bel Paese?
3275,Michael Palin,Sorry.
3276,John Cleese,Red Windsor?
3277,Michael Palin,Normally* sir* yes* but today the van broke down.
3278,John Cleese,Ah. Stilton?
3279,John Cleese,Gruyere? Emmental?
3280,Michael Palin,No.
3281,John Cleese,Any Norwegian Jarlsberger?
3282,John Cleese,Liptauer?
3283,John Cleese,Lancashire?
3284,John Cleese,White Stilton?
3285,John Cleese,Danish Blue?
3286,John Cleese,Double Gloucester?
3287,Michael Palin,...No.
3288,John Cleese,Cheshire?
3289,John Cleese,Any Dorset Blue Vinney?
3290,John Cleese,Brie* Roquefort* Pont-l'Évêque* Port Salut* Savoyard* Saint-Paulin* Carre-de-L'Est* Boursin* Bresse-Bleu* Perle de Champagne* Camenbert?
3291,Michael Palin,Ah! We do have some Camembert* sir.
3292,John Cleese,You do! Excellent.
3293,Michael Palin,It's a bit runny* sir.
3294,John Cleese,Oh* I like it runny.
3295,Michael Palin,Well as a matter of fact it's
3296,Michael Palin,runny* sir.
3297,John Cleese,No matter. No matter. Hand over le fromage de la Belle France qui s'apelle Camembert* s'il vous plaît.
3298,Michael Palin,I think it's runnier than you like it* sir.
3299,John Cleese,I don't care how excrementally runny it is. Hand it over with all speed.
3300,Michael Palin,Yes* sir.
3301,Michael Palin,Oh...
3302,John Cleese,What?
3303,Michael Palin,The cat's eaten it.
3304,John Cleese,Has he?
3305,Michael Palin,She* sir.
3306,John Cleese,Gouda?
3307,John Cleese,Edam?
3308,John Cleese,Caithness?
3309,John Cleese,Smoked Austrian?
3310,John Cleese,Sage Darby?
3311,Michael Palin,No* sir.
3312,John Cleese,You do have some cheese* do you?
3313,Michael Palin,Certainly* sir. It's a cheese shop* sir. We've got...
3314,John Cleese,No* no* no* don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.
3315,Michael Palin,Fair enough.
3316,John Cleese,Wensleydale.
3317,Michael Palin,Yes* sir?
3318,John Cleese,Splendid. Well* I'll have some of that then* please.
3319,Michael Palin,Oh* I'm sorry sir* I thought you were reffering to me* Mr Wensleydale.
3320,John Cleese,Gorgonzola?
3321,John Cleese,Parmesan?
3322,John Cleese,Mozzarella?
3323,John Cleese,Pippo Crème?
3324,John Cleese,Any Danish Fynbo?
3325,John Cleese,Czechoslovakian Sheep's Milk Cheese?
3326,John Cleese,Venezuelan Beaver Cheese?
3327,Michael Palin,Not today sir* no.
3328,John Cleese,Well let's keep it simple* how about Cheddar?
3329,Michael Palin,Well* I'm afraid we don't get much call for it around these parts.
3330,John Cleese,Not call for it? It's the single most popular cheese in the world!
3331,Michael Palin,Not round these parts* sir.
3332,John Cleese,And pray what is the most popular cheese round these parts?
3333,Michael Palin,Ilchester* sir.
3334,John Cleese,I see.
3335,Michael Palin,Yes* sir. It's quite staggeringly popular in the manor* squire.
3336,John Cleese,Is it.
3337,Michael Palin,Yes sir* it's our number-one seller.
3338,Michael Palin,Yes sir.
3339,John Cleese,Ilchester* eh?
3340,Michael Palin,Right.
3341,John Cleese,OK* I'm game. Have you got any* he asked* expecting the answer no?
3342,Michael Palin,I'll have a look* sir...nnnnnnooooooooo.
3343,John Cleese,It's not much of a cheese shop really* is it?
3344,Michael Palin,Finest in the district* sir.
3345,John Cleese,And what leads you to that conclusion?
3346,Michael Palin,Well* it's so clean.
3347,John Cleese,Well* it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese.
3348,Michael Palin,You haven't asked me about Limberger* sir.
3349,John Cleese,Is it worth it?
3350,Michael Palin,Could be.
3351,John Cleese,OK* have you...
3352,Michael Palin,Told you so.
3353,John Cleese,Have you got any Limberger?
3354,John Cleese,No* that figures. It was pretty predictable* really. It was an act of purest optimism to pose the question in the first place. Tell me something* do you have any cheese at all?
3355,John Cleese,Now I'm going to ask you that question once more* and if you say 'no' I'm going to shoot you through the head. Now* do you have any cheese at all?
3356,John Cleese,What a senseless waste of human life.
3357,Michael Palin,Hello everybody.
3358,Michael Palin,I say what a simply super day.
3359,Michael Palin,Yes isn't it? I say anyone for tennis?
3360,Michael Palin,Oh gosh.
3361,John Cleese,THE BBC WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE IN THE WORLD FOR THE LAST ITEM. IT WAS DISGUSTING AND BAD AND THOROUGHLY DISOBEDIENT AND PLEASE DON'T BOTHER TO PHONE UP BECAUSE WE KNOW IT WAS VERY TASTELESS* BUT THEY DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT AND THEY DO ALL COME FROM BROKEN HOMES AND HAVE VERY UNHAPPY PERSONAL LIVES* ESPECIALLY ERIC. ANYWAY* THEY'RE REALLY VERY NICE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH AND VERY WARM IN THE TRADITIONAL SHOW BUSINESS WAY AND PLEASE DON'T WRITE IN EITHER BECAUSE THE BBC IS GOING THROUGH AN UNHAPPY PHASE AT THE MOMENT - WHAT WITH ITS FATHER DYING AND THE MORTGAGE AND BBC 2 GOING OUT WITH MEN.'
3362,John Cleese,Look there's not really a great deal of point in your* sort of hanging on at your end* because I'm afraid there aren't any more jokes or anything.
3363,Michael Palin,August 18th. Fell off near Bovey Tracey. The pump caught in my trouser leg.
3364,Michael Palin,The pump caught in my trouser leg* and my sandwiches were badly crushed.
3365,Michael Palin,These sandwiches* however* were an excellent substitute.
3366,John Cleese,Give us ten woods* Barney.
3367,Michael Palin,Hello!
3368,Michael Palin,Ah! I have only a fifty. Do you have change?
3369,Michael Palin,I'm most awfully sorry.
3370,Michael Palin,Oh* what a stroke of luck. Well* all the very best.
3371,Michael Palin,And thank you again for the excellent banana and cheese delicacy.
3372,Michael Palin,August 23rd. Fell off near Budleigh Salterton.
3373,Michael Palin,...and the pump caught in my trouser leg...
3374,Michael Palin,That shouldn't really happen to a self-sealing container* should it? What do you keep your hard-boiled eggs in?
3375,Michael Palin,I think in future I shall lash them to the handlebars with adhesive tape...this should obviate a recurrence of the same problem...well I can't stop here all day...I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall. Must be off.
3376,Michael Palin,August 26th. Fell off near Ottery St Mary. The pump caught in my trouser leg. Decided to wear short trousers from now on.
3377,Michael Palin,Fell off near Tiverton. Perhaps a shorter pump is the answer.
3378,Michael Palin,Excuse me* madam* I wonder if you could tell me of a good bicycle shop in this village* where I could find either a means of adapting my present pump* or failing that* purchase a replacement?
3379,Michael Palin,What a stroke of luck. Now perhaps cycling will become less precarious.
3380,Michael Palin,Oh* a very good morning to you too* Doctor
3381,Michael Palin,Yes* my pump got...
3382,Michael Palin,Absolutely. Yes. My fruit cake was damaged on one side.
3383,Michael Palin,It's got grit all over it.
3384,Michael Palin,Oh* heavens no.
3385,Michael Palin,Oh* fortunately* I escaped without injury.
3386,Michael Palin,Please* could you tell me the way to Iddesleigh?
3387,Michael Palin,Oh yes* absolutely. Normally I would have asked a policeman or a minister of the Church* but finding no one available* I thought it better to consult a man with some professional qualifications* rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony of a passer-by.
3388,Michael Palin,Thank you.
3389,Michael Palin,September 2nd. Did not fall off outside Iddesley.
3390,Michael Palin,Fell off in Tavistock.
3391,Michael Palin,My foot caught in my trouser leg and that's how the bottle broke.
3392,John Cleese,I can't. I can't.
3393,Michael Palin,I said you'd never guess.
3394,John Cleese,Sixteen years we've been together. I can't just ring her up.
3395,Michael Palin,Do you like Tizer?
3396,John Cleese,What? No. No.
3397,Michael Palin,I suppose it is still available in this area* is it?
3398,John Cleese,What?
3399,Michael Palin,Tizer.
3400,Michael Palin,Is it still available in this area?
3401,John Cleese,I don't know.
3402,John Cleese,No! I mean yes!
3403,Michael Palin,Oh it is* is it?
3404,John Cleese,No.
3405,John Cleese,I can.... I have....
3406,John Cleese,No wait* Lucille!
3407,Michael Palin,Does your lovely daughter like Tizer? Eh?
3408,John Cleese,Lucille!
3409,Michael Palin,Wouldn't mind buying her a bottle of Tizer.... if it's available in this area* that is.
3410,John Cleese,Would you like me to show you the door?
3411,Michael Palin,Oh* that's extremely kind of you* but I saw it on the way in.
3412,John Cleese,You stupid* interfering little rat.
3413,Michael Palin,Oh! The very words of the garage mechanic in Bude!
3414,Michael Palin,I had just fallen off my bicycle* this is most kind of you* and my lemon curd tartlet had...
3415,John Cleese,Damn your lemon curd tartlet!
3416,Michael Palin,Just had a chat with your dad.
3417,Michael Palin,My rubber instep caught on the rear mudguard stanchion and...
3418,Michael Palin,The corned beef rolls squashed out of all...here* how did you know about the corned beef rolls?
3419,Michael Palin,That's right. The curd had become...
3420,Michael Palin,Absolutely right* yes.
3421,Michael Palin,But they were wrapped in foil!
3422,Michael Palin,Oh* that's the bit I like.
3423,Michael Palin,How do you know so much about cycling?
3424,Michael Palin,Really?
3425,Michael Palin,Good heavens!
3426,Michael Palin,Even if it's inside an egg and tomato roll?
3427,Michael Palin,Safer food?
3428,Michael Palin,Er....well...
3429,Michael Palin,Here* that tomato just ejected itself.
3430,Michael Palin,What a strange turn this cycling tour has taken. Mr Gulliver appears to have lost his memory and far from being interested in safer food is now convinced that he is Clodagh Rogers* the young girl singer. I am taking him for medical attention.
3431,Michael Palin,Is this the Casualty Department?
3432,Michael Palin,I am at present on a cycling tour of the North Cornwall area taking in Bude and...
3433,Michael Palin,Ah* my name is Pither.
3434,Michael Palin,P-I-T-H-E-R ...as in Brotherhood* but with PI instead of the BRO and no HOOD.
3435,Michael Palin,I had just visited Taunton...
3436,Michael Palin,...and was cycling north towards...
3437,Michael Palin,Just where the A397 Ilfracombe road meets the...
3438,Michael Palin,Ah no... it's not I who was injured* it's my friend.
3439,Michael Palin,Pither.
3440,Michael Palin,Oh* Clodagh Rogers...
3441,Michael Palin,Well only since about 4:30....
3442,John Cleese,What? Damn!
3443,John Cleese,Now* what's the trouble?
3444,Michael Palin,I am on a cycling tour of...
3445,Michael Palin,I have friend who* as a result of his injuries thinks he is Clodagh Rogers.
3446,John Cleese,He what?
3447,Michael Palin,Well* what happened was...
3448,Michael Palin,Oh hello!
3449,Michael Palin,I did enjoy your song for Europe* Clodagh.
3450,Michael Palin,Danger* Clodagh?
3451,Michael Palin,No one hates you* Clodagh.
3452,Michael Palin,I think you should go and have a little lie down* my dear. There is a busy day tomorrow of concerts and promotional tours.
3453,John Cleese,Taisez-vous. Taisez-vous.
3454,Michael Palin,Oh dear.
3455,John Cleese,Taisez-vous. Qu'est-ce que le bruit? C'est impossible!
3456,Michael Palin,Er... my name is Pither.
3457,John Cleese,Oh... you are English?
3458,Michael Palin,Er yes* that's right. I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall* taking in Bude...
3459,Michael Palin,This is Clodagh Rogers* the Irish-born girl singer.
3460,John Cleese,Trotsky!
3461,John Cleese,Il chante un peu.
3462,John Cleese,Ah! Lenin!! Quel chanteur: 'If I ruled the world'.
3463,Michael Palin,Oh excuse her* she's not very well recently* pressure of work* laryngitis* you know...
3464,John Cleese,Et aussi Monsieur Kerensky avec le 'Little White Bull'* eh?
3465,Michael Palin,After several days I succeeded in tracking down my friend Mr Gulliver on the outskirts of Smolensk.
3466,Michael Palin,Thank you.
3467,Michael Palin,Anyway* as we were so far from home* and as Mr Gulliver* still believing himself to be Trotsky* was very tired from haranguing the masses all the way from Monte Carlo*
3468,Michael Palin,Thank you. I decided to check...
3469,Michael Palin,I decided to check...
3470,Michael Palin,No* sorry you go on.
3471,Michael Palin,I decided to check him into a hotel while I visited the British Embassy to ask for help in returning to Cornwall.
3472,Michael Palin,And so we registered at the Smolensk Young Men's Anti-Christian Association.
3473,Michael Palin,No* not you. A single room for my friend please.
3474,Michael Palin,Well* just have a nice lie down* and I'll go to the Embassy.
3475,Michael Palin,Excuse me. Is this the British Consulate?
3476,Michael Palin,I wish to see the consul* please.
3477,Michael Palin,Oh!
3478,Michael Palin,You are Rear Admiral Sir Dudley Compton?
3479,Michael Palin,Oh* successor.
3480,Michael Palin,Oh.
3481,Michael Palin,Well.... A drink would be very nice.
3482,John Cleese,Yes* Boss.
3483,Michael Palin,Oh well* I'm a West Country man myself* Mr. Atkinson.
3484,Michael Palin,No. No. West of England... Cornwall.
3485,Michael Palin,Cornwall.
3486,Michael Palin,Rather.
3487,Michael Palin,Ah* Pither.
3488,Michael Palin,Oh* cricket?
3489,Michael Palin,Bingo...
3490,John Cleese,Bingo! Bingo!
3491,John Cleese,Bingo.
3492,Michael Palin,Well* it's not really my line...
3493,John Cleese,Housey! Housey!
3494,John Cleese,Nihi watai bingo cards?
3495,John Cleese,Ah so...
3496,Michael Palin,Well* I was hoping that you could help me and my friend to get back to England as...you see we're on a cycling tour of North Cornwall...
3497,Michael Palin,Is Mr Trotsky in his room* please?
3498,Michael Palin,Moscow!
3499,Michael Palin,Oh* who are you?
3500,John Cleese,Well we're not secret police anyway.
3501,John Cleese,None at all. Come with us.
3502,Michael Palin,Oh* where are you taking me?
3503,John Cleese,Agreed.
3504,Michael Palin,Oh a clambake! I've never been to one of those.
3505,John Cleese,Who's giving the orders round here?
3506,John Cleese,No* you're not. You're a greengrocer* I'm an insurance salesman.
3507,John Cleese,You're an ice-cream salesman? I thought you were a vetenarian.
3508,John Cleese,Taxi!
3509,John Cleese,Drive us to Moscow.
3510,John Cleese,...Dostoievye useye tovarich trotsky borodina
3511,John Cleese,Beluntanks dretsky mihai ovna isky Mr Reg Pither.
3512,John Cleese,Shi muska di scensand dravenka oblomov Engleska Solzhenitzhin.
3513,John Cleese,And now* Comrades* the greatest moment of the day* the moment when I ask you to welcome the return of one of Russia's greatest heroes* creator of the Red Army* Lenin's greatest friend* Lev Davidovich Trotsky!
3514,Michael Palin,Our friend Mr Gulliver was clearly undergoing another change of personality.
3515,John Cleese,So! You have duped us. You shall pay for this. Guards* seize him.
3516,John Cleese,Shall I seize him too?
3517,John Cleese,He's more fun than he used to be.
3518,Michael Palin,What a pleasant exercise yard. How friendly they were all being.
3519,John Cleese,Cigarettes?
3520,Michael Palin,Oh* no thank you I don't smoke.
3521,Michael Palin,I looked around but could not see the target.
3522,John Cleese,Blindfold?
3523,Michael Palin,No thank you* no.
3524,John Cleese,Verschnitzen.
3525,John Cleese,A telegram?
3526,Michael Palin,Now I was really for it.
3527,John Cleese,How could you miss?
3528,John Cleese,Shut up! Go and practise.
3529,John Cleese,I'm so sorry. Do you mind waiting in your cell?
3530,Michael Palin,What a stroke of luck. My Crunchie was totally intact. I settled down to a quick intermeal snack...
3531,John Cleese,Next time. Definitely!
3532,John Cleese,Now then* how many of them have been injured? Oh God...
3533,Michael Palin,As I lay dwon to the sound of the Russian gentlemen practising their shooting* I realised I was in a bit of a pickle. My heart sank as I realised I should never see the Okehampton by-pass again...
3534,Michael Palin,Mother!
3535,Michael Palin,So* it was all a dream.
3536,John Cleese,OK* we're going to have another try. I think we've got it now. My boys have been looking down the wrong bit* you see.
3537,Michael Palin,Oh no* look* you've got to look down the bit there.
3538,John Cleese,Oh I thought you had to look down that bit.
3539,Michael Palin,No* no* you've got to look down that bit* or you won't hit anything.
3540,John Cleese,Alright* we'll give it a whirl. Guards* seize him.
3541,John Cleese,Listen. You've got to look down this bit.
3542,Michael Palin,Here!
3543,Michael Palin,Gulliver.
3544,Michael Palin,Well yes and no.
3545,Michael Palin,Phew* what an amazing escape. Well goodbye* Reginald.
3546,Michael Palin,This is Captain MacPherson welcoming you aboard East Scottish Airways. You'll have had your tea. Our destination is Glasgow. There is no need to panic.
3547,John Cleese,I don't believe you.
3548,John Cleese,Including you.
3549,John Cleese,Here's a pound.
3550,John Cleese,One English pound. Now where's the bomb?
3551,John Cleese,You've forgotten.
3552,Michael Palin,Now where's the bomb?
3553,John Cleese,It's in the luggage compartment.
3554,Michael Palin,He's just ruined this sketch.
3555,John Cleese,Yes* absolutely.
3556,John Cleese,No* no.
3557,John Cleese,It's an interesting question. Personally I rather adhere to the Bergsonian idea of laughter as a social sanction against inflexible behaviour but... excuse me a moment... And now...
3558,Michael Palin,It's...
3559,Michael Palin,This new housing development in Bristol is one of the most interesting in the country. It's using a variety of new techniques: shock-proof curtain-walling* a central high voltage* self-generated electricity source* and extruded acrylic fiberglass fitments. It's also the first major housing project in Britain to be built entirely by characters from nineteenth-century English literature.
3560,Michael Palin,Here Little Nell* from Dickens's 'Old Curiosity Shop' fits new nylon syphons into the asbestos-lined ceilings ...
3561,Michael Palin,Arthur Huntingdon* who Helen Graham married as a young girl* and whose shameless conduct eventually drove her back to her brother Lawrence* in Anne Brontë's 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' describes why it's unique.
3562,Michael Palin,The on-site building techniques involve the construction of twelve-foot walling blocks by a crowd of farmhands from 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles' supervised by the genial landlady* Mrs Jupp* from Samuel Butler's 'Way of All Flesh'.
3563,Michael Palin,In contrast to the site in Bristol* it's progress here on Britain's first eighteen-level motorway interchange being built by characters from Milton's 'Paradise Lost'...
3564,Michael Palin,What went wrong here?
3565,Michael Palin,But even more modern building techniques are being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in under a minute.
3566,Michael Palin,The local Council here have over fifty hypnosis-induced twenty-five story blocks* put up by El Mystico and Janet. I asked Mr Ken Verybigliar the advantages of hypnosis compared to other building methods.
3567,Michael Palin,Well there is a considerable financial advantage in using the services of El Mystico. A block* like Mystico Point here*
3568,Michael Palin,would normally cost in the region of one-and-a-half million pounds. This was put up for five pounds and thirty bob for Janet.
3569,Michael Palin,But the obvious question is are they safe?
3570,Michael Palin,You don't mind living in a figment of another man's imagination?
3571,Michael Palin,Where did you used to live?
3572,Michael Palin,Really* that sounds much better.
3573,Michael Palin,But the construction of these vast new housing developments* providing homes for many thousands of people* is not the only project to which he has applied his many talents. He also has an Infallible Pools Method* a School of Spanish Dancing and a Car Hire Service.
3574,Michael Palin,So Mystico has his Janet.
3575,Michael Palin,Yes. Janet ... a quiet* shy girl. An honours graduate from Harvard University* American junior sprint record holder* ex-world skating champion* Nobel Prize winner* architect* novelist and surgeon. The girl who helped crack the Oppenheimer spy ring in 1947. She gave vital evidence to the Senate Narcotics Commission in 1958. She also helped to convict the woman at the chemist's in 1961* and a year later
3576,Michael Palin,was electrocuted for shouting in the corridor.
3577,John Cleese,... and Premier Chou En Lai* who called it 'a major breakthrough'. Twelve men were accidentally hanged at Whitby Assizes this afternoon whilst considering their verdict. This is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in Britain since Tuesday.
3578,John Cleese,Turn that radio off and look lively!
3579,John Cleese,Don't argue* Battersby.
3580,Michael Palin,I see* I see* I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... I can't think of anything to say about it.
3581,Michael Palin,I see... yes... yes ... now... um... what... what... ah... ah... what is it? .... is it a power station?
3582,Michael Palin,I see ... I see ... good ... good ... good* good* good...
3583,Michael Palin,I see* I see ... I ... er... er... er... er ... I ... er ... I'm a good little doggie.
3584,Michael Palin,I'm a good little dog.
3585,Michael Palin,Ah! Now then* excellent* excellent* excellent* excellent. Now then ... ah ... what happens when the steel is poured into the ingots?
3586,Michael Palin,Yes... yes ... yes ... yes... yes rather jolly good... jolly good .. jolly good ... jolly good ... no fear...
3587,John Cleese,Turn that thing off!
3588,John Cleese,Never mind that* Battersby* this is the big one. I've just had Whitby Police on the phone with twelve hangees...
3589,John Cleese,No* these are twelve different ones ... so shtoom.
3590,John Cleese,What?
3591,John Cleese,No* no* it's no good...
3592,John Cleese,No.
3593,Michael Palin,Well* we'll be taking you back there as soon as there are any developments.
3594,Michael Palin,We've just heard that something is happening in the Hide-and-Seek final* so let's go straight over there.
3595,Michael Palin,Really beginning to hot up now.
3596,Michael Palin,The official result of the World Hide-and-Seek* Mr Don Roberts from Hinckley* Leicestershire* 11 years* 2 months* 26 days* 9 hours* 3 minutes* 27 seconds. Mr Francisco Huron* Paraguay* 11 years* a months* 26 days* 9 hours* 3 minutes* 27 seconds. The result - a tie.
3597,John Cleese,A tie! Well what a fantastic result. Well the replay will start tomorrow at 7.30 a.m.
3598,Michael Palin,Well hello again .... nice to be back ... glad to see the series has been doing well. Well now* sorry about Mon-trerx.
3599,Michael Palin,That was a little item entitled Hide-and-Seek - very anarchic* very effective* not quite my cup of tea* but very nice for the younger people. Well* the next item the boys have put together takes place in a sitting room. Sorry it's just a sitting room* but the bank account's a bit low after the appallingly expensive production of 'Clochmerle'...
3600,John Cleese,Sorry about that* darling...
3601,John Cleese,Yes please* dear.
3602,John Cleese,Come in.
3603,John Cleese,Would you like to come through...
3604,John Cleese,It's just neighbourliness dear* that's all...
3605,John Cleese,Can't you be serious for one moment?
3606,John Cleese,I'm sorry I was cross earlier.
3607,John Cleese,Well yes* from now on we'll be like ourselves.
3608,John Cleese,Oh Beatrice.
3609,John Cleese,Well* basically it's quite apparent that these little dago chappies have got it all wrong. They prance round the bull like a lot of bally night club dancers looking like the Younger Generation or a less smooth version of the Lionel Blair Troupe*
3610,John Cleese,What? ... oh...
3611,John Cleese,This is the planet Algon* fifth world in the system of Aldebaran* the Red Giant in the constellation of Sagittarius. Here an ordinary cup of drinking chocolate costs four million pounds* an immersion heater for the hot-water tank costs over six billion pounds* and a pair of split-crotch panties would be almost unobtainable.
3612,Michael Palin,Well* our computers have been working all day to analyse the dramatic information that's come in from this first ever intergalactic probe* Algon I ...
3613,Michael Palin,But we're now getting some live pictures through from Algon! Harry - Perhaps you could talk us through them.
3614,Michael Palin,Of course the big question that everyone's asking here is* what about those split-crotch parities? Are they going to be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself? Professor?
3615,Michael Palin,Professor* you were responsible for finding Scanty-Panties and Golden Goddess High-Lift Bras on planets which were never thought able to sustain life* and now that man has discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear become even naughtier?
3616,Michael Palin,Well so much for that ... But of course* the probe itself has excited a great deal of interest... for it contains uranium-based dual transmission cells entirely re-charged by solar radiation* which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen seconds. It is* of course* the first piece of space hardware to be specially designed to undress ladies* and so there are bound to be some teething troubles ... such as how to cope with the combination of elastic-sided boots and tights.
3617,Michael Palin,But I think we're getting some pictures now from Algon itself* and it looks as though ... yes! The satellite has found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good too! Professor?
3618,Michael Palin,Well the pictures are a bit sporadic... I think probably... the solar radiation during the long journey to Algon...
3619,Michael Palin,Hoy! Look! Oh dear* I'm sorry we've lost contact. We'll try and re-establish contact with Algon...
3620,John Cleese,Yes...
3621,John Cleese,Mmmm... I see ... you don't have anything specially about Devon and Cornwall?
3622,John Cleese,The one I was really after was Arthur Hotchkiss's 'Devonshire Country Churches'.
3623,John Cleese,No ... not really ... I don't suppose you have any general surveys of English Church architecture?
3624,John Cleese,No* I see. Well* never mind I'll just take the 'Lord Lieutenant in Nylons' then* and these two copies of 'Piggie Parade'. Thank you.
3625,Michael Palin,All right. This is a raid. My name is Superintendent Gaskell and this is Sergeant Maddox.
3626,Michael Palin,Shut up.
3627,Michael Palin,Shut up. It's a disguise. Right! Confiscate the smutty books* Maddox.
3628,Michael Palin,Listen* mate! Don't come that Philip Sidney bit with me. I'm not a bloody Tudor at all. I'm Gaskell of the Vice Squad and this is Sergeant Maddox.
3629,Michael Palin,Maddox! Where's he gone?
3630,Michael Palin,Look. This is the last time. I'm warning you* I'm not Sir Philip Bleeding Sidney. I am Superintendent Harold Gaskell and this is a raid.
3631,Michael Palin,Maddox!
3632,Michael Palin,Where are you going?
3633,Michael Palin,Right.
3634,Michael Palin,I'll remember you. Don't you worry. I'll remember you...
3635,Michael Palin,Don't you start! Maddox!
3636,Michael Palin,Hey* stop!
3637,Michael Palin,You'll never get away with this* you porn merchant. Blimey!
3638,Michael Palin,Er* listen. My name is Caskell ... Superintendent Caskell of Vice Squad. Myself and Sergeant Maddox are on a raid. We are not Tudor people. We are the police.
3639,Michael Palin,... Possibly... but I may be Superintendent Gaskell of the Vice Squad.
3640,Michael Palin,All right* sir. I think I will.
3641,Michael Palin,. .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob* who did seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany. For six years they cleaned up a packet - the day I got whiff of them through a squealer and within one week did a mop-up right good. They're now languishing doing five years bird in Parkhurst.
3642,Michael Palin,Let's go.
3643,Michael Palin,Where are the Spaniards?
3644,Michael Palin,Right* you stay here* I'll go and get them.
3645,Michael Palin,Allo allo! What's going on here?
3646,Michael Palin,I know what literature is* you dago dustbin. I also know what porn is.
3647,Michael Palin,What's this then eh?
3648,Michael Palin,Toledo Tit Parade'? What sort of play's that?
3649,Michael Palin,Right. I'm taking this lot in the name of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth.
3650,Michael Palin,Don't give me any trouble. Just pile up these baskets of filth and come with me.
3651,Michael Palin,Good evening all* my love. I have returned safe from the Low Countries.
3652,Michael Palin,What are thou reading* fair one?
3653,Michael Palin,I can see 'tis
3654,Michael Palin,.
3655,Michael Palin,Oh ...'Gay Boys in Bondage' What* is't - tragedy? Comedy?
3656,Michael Palin,How fortunate we are indeed to have such a poet on these shores.
3657,Michael Palin,The Spaniards were defeated thrice. Six dozen chests of hardcore captured.
3658,Michael Palin,Yes* good my wife* this fair coat trimmed with ermine.
3659,Michael Palin,No* no fair lady. The rest was too smutty.
3660,Michael Palin,Now* my good wife. Whilst I rest* read to me a while from Shakespeare's 'Gay Boys in Bondage'.
3661,Michael Palin,Tis like 'Hamlet' ... what a genius!
3662,Michael Palin,There you are* Maddox!
3663,Michael Palin,Maddox! You recognize me...
3664,Michael Palin,Shut up! I know this man - this is my old mate Sergeant Maddox...
3665,Michael Palin,Oh Maddox - it's me - Gaskell ... 'F' division down at Acton ... Inspector Arthur Frodwell.
3666,Michael Palin,I'm not Sir Philip bleedin' Sidney .... and where were you? We could have mopped up that Tudor shop...
3667,John Cleese,It's beautiful* it's Paris all over again.
3668,Michael Palin,Excuse me* do you mind if I join you?
3669,John Cleese,Er* no... no... no... not at all.
3670,Michael Palin,Are you
3671,Michael Palin,you don't mind?
3672,John Cleese,Yes* yes* absolutely.
3673,Michael Palin,You're sure I won't be disturbing you?
3674,John Cleese,No* no.
3675,Michael Palin,You're absolutely sure I won't be disturbing you?
3676,Michael Palin,Good. Because I don't want to disturb you. Specially as you're being so kind about me not disturbing you.
3677,John Cleese,Oh* no* no* we don't mind* do we* darling?
3678,Michael Palin,Good* so I can go ahead and join you then? Can I?
3679,Michael Palin,Won't be disturbing?
3680,Michael Palin,Good* good. You're very kind.
3681,Michael Palin,Let alone when I specifically tell them about my being disturbing.
3682,John Cleese,... Well* it's not
3683,John Cleese,disturbing.
3684,Michael Palin,No* absolutely* absolutely* that's what I always say.
3685,John Cleese,We must be getting on.
3686,Michael Palin,I knew I'd disturb you ... I knew I'd disturb you ...
3687,Michael Palin,It always happens ... whenever I've found someone I really think I'm going to be able to get on with...
3688,John Cleese,No* the only thing is* you see* we're going to be a little bit late.
3689,John Cleese,Well* just a little bit... I mean* we will be late if we don't...
3690,Michael Palin,Oh* thank you. You're very kind.
3691,John Cleese,And now...
3692,Michael Palin,It's...
3693,John Cleese,Good evening. Tonight on 'Is There' we examine the question* 'Is there a life after death?'. And here to discuss it are three dead people... The late Sir Brian Hardacre* former curator of the Imperial War Museum ...
3694,John Cleese,Professor? ... Prebendary?.... Well there we have it* three say no. On 'Is There' next week we'll be discussing the question 'Is there enough of it about?'* and until then* goodnight.
3695,Michael Palin,Good doctor morning! Nice year for the time of day!
3696,John Cleese,Come in.
3697,Michael Palin,Can I down sit?
3698,John Cleese,Certainly.
3699,John Cleese,Well* then?
3700,Michael Palin,Well* now* not going to bush the doctor about the beat too long. I'm going to come to point the straight immediately.
3701,John Cleese,Good* good.
3702,Michael Palin,My particular prob* or buglem bear* I've had ages. For years* I've had it for donkeys.
3703,John Cleese,What?
3704,Michael Palin,I'm up to here with it* I'm sick to death. I can't take you any longer so I've come to see it.
3705,John Cleese,Ah* now this is your problem with words.
3706,Michael Palin,This is my problem with words. Oh* that seems to have cleared it. 'Oh I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee'. Yes* that seems to be all right. Thank you very much.
3707,John Cleese,I see. But recently you have been having this problem with your word order.
3708,Michael Palin,Well* absolutely* and what makes it worse* sometimes at the end of a sentence I'll come out with the wrong fusebox.
3709,John Cleese,Fusebox?
3710,Michael Palin,And the thing about saying the wrong word is a) I don't notice it* and b) sometimes orange water given bucket of plaster.
3711,John Cleese,Yes* tell me more about your problem.
3712,Michael Palin,Well as I say* you'd just be talking and out'll pudenda the wrong word and ashtray's your uncle. So I'm really strawberry about it.
3713,John Cleese,Upset?
3714,Michael Palin,It's so embarrassing when my wife and I go to an orgy.
3715,John Cleese,A party?
3716,Michael Palin,No* an orgy. We live in Esher.
3717,John Cleese,Quite.
3718,Michael Palin,That's what I said. Such a bloody whack the diddle fa di la* fo di la* lo do di ... do di do* rum fum.
3719,John Cleese,Mr Burrows* this is no common problem. You are suffering from a disease so rare that it hasn't got a name. Not yet. But it will have. Oh yes. This is the opportunity I've been waiting for. The chance of a lifetime!
3720,John Cleese,I'll show them at the Royal College of Surgeons! I'll make them sit up and take notice! Thripshaw's disease! Discovered by E. Henry Thripshaw MD! I'll be invited on 'Call My Bluff' and the merchandizing* there'll be E. Henry Thripshaw t-shirts ... I'll turn it into a game ... I'll sell the film rights.
3721,John Cleese,Well* I feel that they have missed the whole point of my disease.
3722,John Cleese,Yes* well you see* they've dragged in all this irrelevant mush...
3723,John Cleese,Well at the moment I am working on a new disease* which I hope to turn into a musical* but* primarily we are working on a re-make of my first disease and this time we're hoping to do it properly.
3724,John Cleese,Well now* what seems to be the matter?
3725,Michael Palin,The next sketch starts after some silly noises.
3726,Michael Palin,Come in.
3727,Michael Palin,By all means ... by all means* sir. Do sit down.
3728,Michael Palin,Ah* sit on the desk here.
3729,Michael Palin,Now then* a glass of sherry?
3730,Michael Palin,Are you sure? I'm going to have some.
3731,Michael Palin,Oh... well there's only just enough for me.
3732,Michael Palin,You see* if I split what's left* there'd be hardly any left for me at all.
3733,Michael Palin,Good! So* I can have it all ... now then what's the problem?
3734,Michael Palin,Ah! I've found another bottle! You can have some now if you want to.
3735,Michael Palin,Oh you don't have to. I can drink the whole bottle.
3736,Michael Palin,Good! That's another bottle for me. Do go on.
3737,Michael Palin,Come in!
3738,Michael Palin,Ah* Mr Husband ... this is Mr Kirkham* one of my parishioners* this is Mr Husband of the British Sherry Corporation...
3739,Michael Palin,No* no ... no do stay here. Have a sherry... you won't be long will you* Husband?
3740,Michael Palin,There we are... there we are* Mr Husband. Now* how about you* Mr Kirkham?
3741,Michael Palin,Oh well* there's not much now.
3742,Michael Palin,Good. Right... now* then* what is the problem* Husband?
3743,Michael Palin,And how many glasses is that?
3744,Michael Palin,That's excellent* Husband* excellent.
3745,Michael Palin,Yes... and I could have dry sherry on the roof and Amontillado in the underground tank!
3746,Michael Palin,Excellent work* Husband* excellent work.
3747,Michael Palin,Terrific. Now then* Mr Kirkham
3748,Michael Palin,I am so sorry... do go on.
3749,Michael Palin,Well* look...
3750,Michael Palin,Dirty books* please.
3751,Michael Palin,E. Henry Thripshaw t-shirts are now available from BBC Enterprises. The price hasn't finally been decided* and the address to write to...they haven't yet quite worked out.
3752,Michael Palin,Boxing Tonight' comes from the Empire Pool* Wembley and features the main heavyweight bout between Jack Bodell* British and Empire Heavyweight Champion.
3753,Michael Palin,It's the first time these two have met so there should be some real action tonight...
3754,Michael Palin,He's down! Sir Kenneth Clark is down in eight seconds. But he's up again. He's up at six...
3755,Michael Palin,And he's down again* and I don't think he's going to get up this time.
3756,Michael Palin,No* so Jack Bodel has defeated Sir Kenneth Clark in the very first round here tonight and so this big Lincolnshire heavyweight becomes the new Oxford Professor of Fine Art.
3757,John Cleese,Thank you* thank you* thank you* ladies and gentlemen. And now...
3758,Michael Palin,It's...
3759,John Cleese,Stand and deliver! Drop that gun!
3760,John Cleese,You see the three trees* the third from the left and back a bit - that one - I reckon I clould hit that four times out of five...on a good day. Say with this wind...say* say* seven times out of ten...
3761,John Cleese,Which one?
3762,John Cleese,No* no* no* not that one.
3763,John Cleese,No* that's not an elm. An elm's got sort of great clumps of leaves like that. That's either a beech or a...er...hornbeam.
3764,John Cleese,Oh* no not a hornbeam* What's the tree that has a leaf with sort of regular veins coming out and the veins go all the way out to the...
3765,John Cleese,...to the serrated edges.
3766,John Cleese,That's right.
3767,John Cleese,Well it doesn't matter* anyway. I can hit it seven times out of ten* that's the point.
3768,John Cleese,Shut up! This is a hold-up* not a botany lesson. Right* now my fine friends* no false moves please. I want you to hand over all the lupins you've got.
3769,John Cleese,Yes* lupins. Come on* come on.
3770,John Cleese,Don't try to play for time.
3771,John Cleese,Yes* that's right.
3772,John Cleese,Look* my fine friends. I happen to know that this is the Lupin Express.
3773,John Cleese,Get out of the coach. Come on* get out!
3774,John Cleese,Here we are* I'll be back.
3775,Michael Palin,And this is where you at home can join in.
3776,Michael Palin,Morning* Mr Henson ... How are we today?
3777,Michael Palin,OK* take it easy ...
3778,Michael Palin,Expecting any postal orders this week?
3779,Michael Palin,Righto.
3780,Michael Palin,Ah* Mr Rodgers* have you got your unemployment benefit please? Right. Well can you write me a cheque then... please?
3781,Michael Palin,Thank you very much. Soon have you down to nothing. Ah* Mr Millichope.

3790,Michael Palin,In 1648.
3791,Michael Palin,Meanwhile Frederick William of Denmark* taking advantage of the absence of Charles XII* seized them; 1712.
3792,Michael Palin,Oh* thank you.
3793,Michael Palin,While Frederick William had married George's only daughter.
3794,John Cleese,Stand and deliver.
3795,John Cleese,The same. And now my lords* my ladies ...your lupins* please.
3796,John Cleese,Oh* come come* don't play games with me my Lord of Buckingham.
3797,John Cleese,Your life or your lupins* my lord.
3798,John Cleese,In a bunch* in a bunch.
3799,John Cleese,Thank you my friends* and now a good evening to you all.
3800,Michael Palin,He seeks them here ... he seeks them there ... he seeks those lupins everywhere. The murdering blackguard! He's taken all our lupins.
3801,Michael Palin,Oh Mr Moore* Mr Moore* she's going fast.
3802,John Cleese,Don't worry* I've... I've brought you something.
3803,Michael Palin,Medicine at last?
3804,John Cleese,No.
3805,Michael Palin,Food?
3806,Michael Palin,Some blankets perhaps... clothes... wood for the fire...
3807,John Cleese,No. Lupins!
3808,Michael Palin,Oh Christ!
3809,John Cleese,I thought you liked them.
3810,Michael Palin,I'm sick to bloody death of them.
3811,Michael Palin,She's bloody dying and all you bring us is lupins. All we've eaten mate for the last four bleeding weeks is lupin soup* roast lupin* steamed lupin* braised lupin in lupin sauce* lupin in the basket with sauted lupins* lupin meringue pie* lupin sorbet... we sit on lupins* we sleep in lupins* we feed the cat on lupins* we burn lupins* we even
3812,Michael Palin,the bloody things!
3813,John Cleese,Looks very smart.
3814,Michael Palin,Oh shut up! We're sick to death with the stench of them.
3815,Michael Palin,!
3816,John Cleese,Like what?
3817,Michael Palin,Like gold and silver and clothes and wood and jewels and...
3818,John Cleese,Hang on* I'll get a piece of paper.
3819,Michael Palin,Meanwhile* a breach had now opened with...
3820,Michael Palin,Oh no* not again.
3821,John Cleese,Stand and deliver again! Your money* your jewellery* your ... hang on.
3822,John Cleese,Your clothes* your snuff* your ornaments* your glasswear* your pussy cats...
3823,John Cleese,Your watches* your lace* your spittoons...
3824,John Cleese,Here we are.
3825,John Cleese,Mr Justice Burke.
3826,John Cleese,And the winner is - number 41* Mr Justice Burke.
3827,John Cleese,Well that's all very well* sir* but this is an off-licence.
3828,John Cleese,Certainly... Amontillado?
3829,John Cleese,Yes* yes sir. Just one bottle?
3830,John Cleese,There we are* sir. That'll be a pound* please.
3831,John Cleese,Excuse me* sir.
3832,John Cleese,I was just wondering. Are you a poet?
3833,John Cleese,Oh
3834,John Cleese,up.
3835,John Cleese,Oh really? Well* don't worry* sir - I used to suffer from short stories.
3836,John Cleese,Oh* once upon a time ... there lived in Wiltshire a young Chap called Dennis Moore. Now Dennis was a highwayman by profession ...
3837,John Cleese,... and for several months he had been stealing from the rich to give to the poor. One day...
3838,John Cleese,Here we are again* Mr Jenkins.
3839,Michael Palin,... which he had seized in the War of the Austrian succession against his word.
3840,John Cleese,My lords* my ladies* on your feet* please.
3841,John Cleese,point of view* it's perfectly satisfactory...
3842,John Cleese,Why are any of us here? I mean* when you get down to it* it's all so meaningless* isn't it? I mean what do any of us want...
3843,John Cleese,Oh I see* oh just the usual things* a little place of my own* the right girl...
3844,Michael Palin,No* no* no! What do you want from
3845,Michael Palin,?
3846,John Cleese,Oh sorry. Your gold* your silver* your jewellery.
3847,John Cleese,That's nice. I'll have them. Come on.
3848,John Cleese,Thank you very much* I've gone through that stage.
3849,Michael Palin,What you got for us today then.
3850,John Cleese,Well I've managed to find you four very nice silver spoons Mr Jenkins.
3851,Michael Palin,Who do you think you are giving us poor this rubbish?
3852,Michael Palin,Yes* why don't you go out and steal something nice like some Venetian silver.
3853,John Cleese,Oh all right.
3854,John Cleese,What did you sing?
3855,John Cleese,Wait a tic ... blimey* this redistribution of wealth is trickier than I thought.
3856,Michael Palin,Good evening and welcome to another edition of 'Prejudice' - the show that gives you a chance to have a go at Wops* Krauts* Nigs* Eyeties* Gippos* Bubbles* Froggies* Chinks* Yidds* Jocks* Polacks* Paddies and Dagoes.
3857,Michael Palin,Tonight's show comes live from the tiny village of Rabid in Buckinghamshire* and our first question tonight is from a Mrs Elizabeth Scrint who says she is going on a Mediterranean cruise next week and can't find anything wrong with the Syrians. Well* Mrs Scrint* apart from being totally unprincipled left-wing troublemakers* the Syrians are also born skivers* they're dirty* smelly and untrustworthy* and* of course* they're friends of the awful gippos.
3858,Michael Palin,So before the streets start emptying in Chelsea tonight* Let's go straight over to our popular prejudiced panel game and invite you once again to - Shoot The Poof! And could our first contestant sign in please.
3859,John Cleese,Our first contestant is a hairdresser from...
3860,Michael Palin,I never did like that kind of person... !
3861,John Cleese,Halt! Halt!
3862,John Cleese,Good evening. Figures talk. We have already fulfilled over three of our election pledges before the end of our second year of good Conservative rule. And* what is more
3863,John Cleese,...
3864,John Cleese,... five and six and seven and down... it's so much harder with the words.
3865,John Cleese,And ...
3866,John Cleese,and ... no* I can't really...
3867,John Cleese,I see. I can do it when you're here.
3868,John Cleese,And
3869,John Cleese,-er.
3870,John Cleese,And now...
3871,Michael Palin,It's...
3872,Michael Palin,Hello.
3873,Michael Palin,... of Edingrund ... dydburing... Edingbir... Edinburgh! Castle ... was... siluted ... sil ... sillhou...
3874,John Cleese,The sunset was dying over the hills of Solway Firth. The lone piper on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle was silhouetted against the crim ... crim ... crimisy... crimson! against the crimson strays ... stree...
3875,John Cleese,Streaked?
3876,Michael Palin,Galloped!
3877,Michael Palin,The lone piper on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle...
3878,Michael Palin,So successful has been the training of the Kamikaze Regiment that the numbers have dwindled from 30*000 to just over a dozen in three weeks. What makes these young Scotsmen so keen to kill themselves?
3879,Michael Palin,The money's good!
3880,John Cleese,All right* sergeant major. At ease. Now* how many chaps have you got left?
3881,John Cleese,Six?
3882,John Cleese,Jolly good show* sergeant major.
3883,John Cleese,Well* I've come to tell you that we've got a job for your five lads.
3884,John Cleese,For your four lads.
3885,John Cleese,Now* which ... er ... which four are they?
3886,John Cleese,... er ... sergeant major!
3887,John Cleese,You don't think it might be a good idea... er... to stop the training programme for a little bit?
3888,John Cleese,Yes ... I know... but... er ...
3889,John Cleese,You see what is worrying me* sergeant major* is...
3890,John Cleese,Er... MacPherson...
3891,John Cleese,Sergeant major* what's this man's name?
3892,John Cleese,No* no* no* no.
3893,John Cleese,Hang on to MacDonald* sergeant major* hang on to him.
3894,John Cleese,What's that?
3895,John Cleese,Well* can't we get him out of it?
3896,John Cleese,Well* there must be someone else who can advise us?
3897,Michael Palin,Good morning* Kamikaze* please.
3898,Michael Palin,Thank you.
3899,John Cleese,Right* sergeant major - there's no time to lose.
3900,John Cleese,No time to lose.
3901,John Cleese,No time ... no time to lose.
3902,John Cleese,Yes* that's right* yes.
3903,John Cleese,Right.
3904,John Cleese,Well* it's in perfectly common parlance.
3905,John Cleese,Oh never mind... right ... no time to lose.
3906,John Cleese,What?
3907,John Cleese,Look* I don't think you've quite got the hang of this phrase* sergeant major.
3908,Michael Palin,Well* I was thinking of using it ... er .. like ..* well ... 'good morning dear* what is in no time to lose?'
3909,Michael Palin,Yes* that's right.
3910,Michael Palin,You see my wife and I have never had a great deal to say to each other ...
3911,Michael Palin,In the old days we used to find things to say* like 'pass the sugar'... or* 'that's my flannel'* but in the last ten or fifteen years there just hasn't seemed to be anything to say* and anyway I saw your phrase advertised in the paper and I thought* that's the kind of thing I'd like to say to her...
3912,Michael Palin,Yes.
3913,Michael Palin,No!
3914,Michael Palin,to lose!
3915,Michael Palin,No time to
3916,Michael Palin,?
3917,Michael Palin,No
3918,Michael Palin,to lose.
3919,Michael Palin,No time
3920,Michael Palin,lose...
3921,Michael Palin,No time Toulouse...
3922,Michael Palin,No - no time to
3923,Michael Palin,!
3924,John Cleese,Anyway* no time to lose* sergeant major.
3925,John Cleese,Right* here are the plans sergeant major* good luck.
3926,John Cleese,And good luck to you* MacDonald.
3927,John Cleese,Very good* sergeant major.
3928,Michael Palin,So it was that on a cold November morning* RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald* one of the most highly trained Kamikaze experts the Scottish Highlands have ever witnessed* left on a mission which was to... oh I can't go on with this drivel.
3929,John Cleese,Well* that's the mission - now here's the method. RSM Murdoch will lull the enemy into a false sense of security by giving them large quantities of money* a good home* and a steady job. Then* when they're upstairs with the wife* Sapper MacDonald will hurl himself at the secret documents* destroying them and himself. Well* that's the plan* the time is now 19.42 hours. I want you to get to bed* have a good night's rest and be up on parade early in the morning. Thank you for listening and thank you for a lovely supper.
3930,Michael Palin,And...and...sue...so...the...the...intripid...
3931,Michael Palin,Intrepid RSM Urdoch and super...
3932,Michael Palin,Sapper MacDonald...mead...
3933,Michael Palin,Made their why...
3934,Michael Palin,Way toarra...
3935,Michael Palin,Towards the Rusty...Ritzy...
3936,Michael Palin,Russian bolder...
3937,Michael Palin,...and so RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald made their way towards the Russian bolder...
3938,John Cleese,Penguins* yes* penguins. What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well* strangely enough quite a lot* a major breakthrough* maybe. It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins* these comic flightless web-footed little bastards may finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind. Professor Rosewall of the Laver Institute.
3939,Michael Palin,For a penguin to have the same size of brain as a man the penguin would have to be over sixty-six feet high.
3940,Michael Palin,Soon these feathery little hustlers were infiltrating important positions everywhere.
3941,John Cleese,We must study them in conditions of absolute secrecy.
3942,John Cleese,Look out!
3943,John Cleese,He hasn't gone off.
3944,John Cleese,Yes my General!
3945,Michael Palin,Good evening.
3946,Michael Palin,The legendary south face of Ben Medhui* dark ... forbidding...
3947,John Cleese,Was Sir Walter Scott a loony* or was he the greatest flowering of the early nineteenth-century romantic tradition? The most underestimated novelist of the nineteenth century...
3948,John Cleese,. . . or merely a disillusioned and embittered man ...
3949,Michael Palin,Excuse me ...
3950,Michael Palin,can I borrow that* please.
3951,John Cleese,... yes.
3952,Michael Palin,Thank you.
3953,Michael Palin,The Forestry Commission systematically replanted this entire area...
3954,John Cleese,Excuse me.
3955,Michael Palin,Sh! That's forty thousand acres of virgin forest. By 1980 this will have risen to two hundred thousand acres of soft woods. In commercial terms* a coniferous cornucopia... an evergreen El Dorado...
3956,Michael Palin,... a tree-lined treasure trove ... No ... a fat fir-coned future for the financiers ... but what of the cost ...
3957,John Cleese,It's mine!
3958,Michael Palin,Go away ... in human terms? Who are the casualties?
3959,John Cleese,For this was Sir Walter Scott's country. Many of his finest romances* such as 'Guy Mannering' and 'Redgauntlet'...
3960,Michael Palin,Give that back!
3961,John Cleese,No.
3962,John Cleese,Scott showed himself to be not only a fine...
3963,Michael Palin,The spruces and flowers of this forest will be used to create a whole new industry here in...
3964,John Cleese,... also a writer of humour and...
3965,Michael Palin,Britain's timber resources are being used up at a rate of...
3966,John Cleese,One man who knew Scott was Angus Tinker.
3967,John Cleese,In the Waverley novels... Scott was constantly concerned to protect a way of life...
3968,John Cleese,....safeguarding nationalist traditions and aspiration* within the necessary limitations of the gothic novel...
3969,Michael Palin,Then... theen... the... the end! The End.
3970,John Cleese,And now...
3971,Michael Palin,It's...
3972,John Cleese,There is only one thing in the world worse than being witty* and that is not being witty.
3973,John Cleese,You will* Oscar* you will.
3974,John Cleese,You did* Oscar* you did.
3975,John Cleese,I never said that.
3976,John Cleese,... Well* Your Highness* what I meant was that* like a doughnut* um* your arrival gives us pleasure and your departure only makes us hungry for more.
3977,John Cleese,Your Highness* you are also like a stream of bat's piss.
3978,John Cleese,It was one of Wilde's. One of Wilde's.
3979,Michael Palin,I ... I merely meant* Your Majesty* that you shine out like a shaft of gold when all around is dark.
3980,John Cleese,Before you arrive - before you arrive is pleasure* and after is a pain in the dong.
3981,Michael Palin,You bastards. Um ... what I meant* Your Majesty* what I meant ...
3982,John Cleese,Come on* Shaw-y.
3983,Michael Palin,I merely meant ...
3984,John Cleese,Let's have a bit of wit* then* man.
3985,John Cleese,Who is-a Geoff Boycott?
3986,Michael Palin,And in t'film* we get Fred Titmus...
3987,John Cleese,Si* Titmus* si* si...
3988,Michael Palin,...the symbol of man's regeneration through radical Marxism...fair enough...but we never once get a chance to see him turn his off-breaks on that Brisbane sticky.
3989,John Cleese,Er* hello Mr and Mrs and Mrs Zambesi?
3990,John Cleese,No* I've just come to say that he's on his way. Would you sign this please.
3991,John Cleese,Thank you very much.
3992,John Cleese,Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
3993,John Cleese,Thank you.
3994,John Cleese,Um* he's just coming now.
3995,John Cleese,Here he is.
3996,Michael Palin,Good morning - Mr and Mrs and Mrs Zambesi?
3997,Michael Palin,All right* Rutherford* I'll take over.
3998,Michael Palin,Yes* we sell a lot of these. Right* shall we try a fitting?
3999,Michael Palin,No* madam* you just strap it on.
4000,Michael Palin,Not the Roadster* madam* no. You're thinking of the Brainette Major.
4001,Michael Palin,Forty-four-and-six.
4002,Michael Palin,Not with the Curry's surgery we use* no* madam.
4003,Michael Palin,Now then. The best bet is the Bertrand Russell Super Silver. That's a real beauty - 250 quid plus hospital treatment.
4004,Michael Palin,It's colour. Right.
4005,Michael Palin,One* two* three* testing* testing.
4006,Michael Palin,Quiet please. It's not adjusted yet.
4007,Michael Palin,Right* one* two* three ...
4008,Michael Palin,Quiet please. Mrs Zambesi* who wrote the theory of relativity?
4009,Michael Palin,Quiet* please!
4010,Michael Palin,Good.
4011,Michael Palin,Right. That'll be 13/6d please.
4012,Michael Palin,She can take it off at night* unless she wants to read* of course. And don't ask her too many questions because it will get hot. If you do have any trouble here is my card.
4013,Michael Palin,Good Bye.
4014,John Cleese,He's gone now.
4015,John Cleese,Blood donors that way* please.
4016,John Cleese,Thank you.
4017,John Cleese,No. There is no such thing as a urine bank.
4018,John Cleese,No. We have no call for it. We've quite enough of it without volunteers coming in here donating it.
4019,John Cleese,No* we don't want a specimen. We either want your blood or nothing.
4020,John Cleese,What?
4021,John Cleese,No* no* just go away please.
4022,John Cleese,Fine* well you don't have to* you see* just go away.
4023,John Cleese,No.
4024,John Cleese,No* look* this is a blood bank - all we want is blood.
4025,John Cleese,Wher did you get that?
4026,John Cleese,What group is it?
4027,John Cleese,There's A...
4028,John Cleese,Wait a moment. It's mine. This blood is mine! What are you doing with it?
4029,John Cleese,You
4030,John Cleese,it? You stole it out of my body* didn't you?
4031,John Cleese,No wonder I'm feeling off-colour.
4032,John Cleese,Give that back.
4033,John Cleese,It is not yours. You stole it.
4034,John Cleese,Give it back to me.
4035,John Cleese,...Get in the queue.
4036,Michael Palin,Good afternoon and welcome to Wife-Swapping from Redcar. And the big news this morning is that the British boy Boris Rodgers has succeeded in swapping his nine-stone Welsh-born wife for a Ford Popular and a complete set of Dickens. Well now* I can see they're ready at the start and so let's go now over for the start of the 3.30.
4037,Michael Palin,And first let's catch up with the latest news of the betting.
4038,Michael Palin,And here's the starter Mrs Alec Marsh*
4039,Michael Palin,and they're off.
4040,Michael Palin,And Mrs Rodgers is the frirst to show* there she goes into Mr Johnson's* and Mrs Johnson across too Mr Colyer* followed closely by Mrs Casey on the inside. Mrs Parkinson* number 12* going well there into Mr Webster's from the Co-op* Mrs Colyer's making ground fast after a poor start* she's out of Mr Casey's into Mr Parkinson's* she's a couple og lengths ahead of Mrs Johnson who's still not out of Mr Casey's. Mrs Penguin and Mrs Colyer - these two now at the head of the field from Mrs Brown* Mrs Atkins* Mrs Parkinson* Mrs Warner and Mrs Rudd - all still at Mr Phillip's. Mrs Penguin making the running now* challenged strongly by Mrs Casey* Mars Casey coming very fast on the inside* it's going to be Mrs Casey coming from behind. Now she's making a break on the outside* Mrs Penguin running...and at the line it's Mrs Casey who's got it by a short head from Mrs Penguin in second place* Mrs Parkinson in third* Mrs Rudd* Mrs Colyer* Mrs Warner and there's Mrs Griffiths who's remained unswapped.
4041,Michael Palin,Well* a very exciting race there* and I have with me now the man who owned and trained the winner* Mrs Casey - Mr Casey. Well done* Jack.
4042,Michael Palin,Well* were you at all surprised about this* Jack?
4043,Michael Palin,Well* thank you very much indeed* Jack. We must leave you now because it's time for the team event.
4044,Michael Palin,And now it's time for Rugby League* and highlights of this afternoon's game between Keighley and Hull Kingston Rovers.
4045,Michael Palin,Just a reminder that on 'Match of the Day' tonight you can see highlights of two of this afternoon's big games. Mrs Robinson v Manchester United and Southampton v Mr Rogers* a rather unusual game that. And here's a late result...Convetry nil* Mr Johnson's Una three - Coventry going down at home* there. Just a little reminder that the next sport you can see on BBS 1 will be 9.20 on Wednesday night* when 'Wife Swapping with Coleman' comes live from my place. Till then* goodnight.
4046,Michael Palin,Oh* my God!
4047,Michael Palin,come on... come on... momentous ascent* the brothers took one last look at their craft* as it stood on the field of Annencay.
4048,Michael Palin,It's er... very nice to be here.
4049,Michael Palin,Yes... yes* oh definitely... yes... yes. Oh aye* aye.
4050,Michael Palin,Where?
4051,Michael Palin,Oh yes* we've come from Paris... yes... yes* yes* we've just come from... er... Paris... yes.
4052,Michael Palin,Well... er... Mr Montgolfier... let's not beat around the bush ... my... dukes and I are very busy men. What we'd like to do is see the plans of your proposed balloon... if that's at all possible.
4053,Michael Palin,Oh* great .... then... what we would like to do ... is er... to take them back with us for the Royal Archives of er...
4054,Michael Palin,France* aye.
4055,Michael Palin,Right! OK! Let's get 'em.
4056,Michael Palin,Did I say Louis XIV? Oh* sorry* I meant Louis XV... Louis XV.
4057,Michael Palin,All right* Louis
4058,Michael Palin,!... listen to me* smartarse* when you're King of France*... you've got better things to do than go around all day remembering your bloody number.
4059,Michael Palin,Right! You want to argue about numbers?
4060,Michael Palin,Right* well... lets get hold of the plans for the Royal Archives. We've got to get back to... er...
4061,Michael Palin,Paris by tonight so get a move on..
4062,Michael Palin,Will Louis XVI get away with the Montgolfiers' precious plans? Is sixteen years of work to be stolen by this suspect sovereign? Is France really in the grip of a Glaswegian monarch? Watch next week's episode of 'The Golden Age of Ballooning'... Now!
4063,Michael Palin,Lord Interest?
4064,Michael Palin,The Montgolfier brothers' plans did indeed turn up... six months later* and a long way from Paris* at the court of King George III of England.
4065,Michael Palin,Your Majesty... I am Louis XVI as you so rightly say* and I don't want to muck about. I have a wee proposition which could make the name of George IV the most respected in Europe...
4066,Michael Palin,George III! Sorry. Where can we talk?
4067,Michael Palin,No no* look* I can't hang about. It's take it or leave... we got to get back to... er...
4068,Michael Palin,Paris* by tonight...
4069,Michael Palin,I'd rather just sell the plans and nip off* Georgie boy.
4070,Michael Palin,Do what?
4071,Michael Palin,Ten thousand
4072,Michael Palin,! Right* well* we'll disengage the* urn* you know... like you said - we'll disengage 'em... tell you what* then* I'll put a duke on to it... OK? Right!
4073,Michael Palin,You asked for it* sonny.
4074,Michael Palin,No* look* I think it's better if you give the money to us. We're going back. We've got a bag.
4075,Michael Palin,Ah! Well* actually* we'd rather you didn't... we've been having a wee bit of trouble with him... you know what I mean?
4076,Michael Palin,Er... aye* yeah... the trouble is he's been drinking a bit recently ... you' know* fourteen lagers with his breakfast... that sort of thing.
4077,Michael Palin,Oh* Christ!
4078,Michael Palin,I got it right!
4079,Michael Palin,Listen* you spotty sassenach pillock..
4080,Michael Palin,George III was arranged and composed by Neil Innes. He is available from the BBC price £4 or eight months' imprisonment.
4081,Michael Palin,Ferdinand von Zeppelin was born in Constance in 1838* the brother of Barry Zeppelin* the least talented of the fourteen Zeppelin brothers.
4082,Michael Palin,Meanwhile for Ferdinand von Zeppelin* the year 1908 was a year of triumph.
4083,Michael Palin,Herr Zeppelin - it's wonderful! It's put ballooning right back on the map.
4084,Michael Palin,Well* it's very nice anyway.
4085,Michael Palin,Yorkshire ... pudding. A type of thick pancake* eaten with large ...
4086,Michael Palin,Za... bag... lione... a sort of cream mouse... mousse of Italian origin...
4087,Michael Palin,Ferdinand... that was a Minister of State you just threw out of the balloon.
4088,Michael Palin,All right* I'm sorry.
4089,Michael Palin,Zu... cchin... ni ... Italian... ma... flows...
4090,Michael Palin,With tiny pieces of sliced...
4091,Michael Palin,What? Prince Von Bülow? Here?
4092,Michael Palin,Coming here?
4093,Michael Palin,Oh* I must go and put my old uniform on.
4094,Michael Palin,Dead? Here?
4095,Michael Palin,This is our sitting room* dear.
4096,Michael Palin,room!
4097,Michael Palin,Well...
4098,Michael Palin,Which one is Von Bülow?
4099,Michael Palin,Oh* ja ... and Admiral Tirpitz!
4100,Michael Palin,And Von Müller... and Herr Reichner... and Hollweg and Von Graunberg...
4101,Michael Palin,He's a lot older than I thought.
4102,Michael Palin,... and Zimmermann ... and Kimpte...
4103,Michael Palin,We must ring the Government.
4104,Michael Palin,Oh dear.
4105,Michael Palin,room.
4106,Michael Palin,There are no members of the Government dead in our sitting room.
4107,Michael Palin,Perhaps I should make a little speech or something?
4108,Michael Palin,Shall we make them a cup of tea?
4109,Michael Palin,But we must do something - so many important people in our drawing room - we must do
4110,Michael Palin,.
4111,Michael Palin,And make a little list.
4112,Michael Palin,And we can sort them out alphabetically?
4113,Michael Palin,Ja.
4114,Michael Palin,That is my reading chair.
4115,Michael Palin,All right ... but I think he would have been better up against the clock* you know.
4116,Michael Palin,I did not say
4117,Michael Palin,the clock.
4118,Michael Palin,We could put the Minister for Colonies under the clock. He's small.
4119,Michael Palin,Soon we shall be able to make a list.
4120,Michael Palin,I don't know. I've never seen him before.
4121,Michael Palin,He's
4122,Michael Palin,the drawing room* my dear.
4123,Michael Palin,Put him in the sitting room.
4124,Michael Palin,You can put him in the sitting room if he's in the drawing room.
4125,Michael Palin,Count Ferdinand Von Zeppelin's behaviour on that flight in 1900 had incredible* far-reaching consequences* for one of the falling Ministers
4126,Michael Palin,producer and director of 'The Golden Age of Ballooning'.
4127,Michael Palin,Woooooo ....ooooooo...
4128,Michael Palin,Yes* sir* can I be of any assistance?
4129,Michael Palin,I'm sorry* sir... try what?
4130,Michael Palin,I'm afraid I don't* sir.
4131,Michael Palin,I don't think I was* sir.
4132,Michael Palin,There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding* sir.
4133,Michael Palin,Yes* I'm the manager.
4134,Michael Palin,It's a smashing store this* I can't recommend it too highly* well-lit* rat-free. It's a joy to manage. Oh yes* the freshest haddock in London* second floor* third floor Ribena* ants here* television and flame throwers over there* behind them our dinner-wagon exhibition closes at six...
4135,Michael Palin,Yes - good morning* sir - can I help you?
4136,Michael Palin,Ah yes - and what price were you thinking of paying* sir?
4137,Michael Palin,Well sir* they start about half a p. but they can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a champion - inflation I'm afraid...
4138,Michael Palin,Ah yes* well you should get a very serviceable little animal for that* sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of?
4139,Michael Palin,Medium. Medium. Here we are* sir.
4140,Michael Palin,That one there is an Ayrshire* and that one there is a King George bitch I think ... and that one killing the little flitbat is an Afghan.
4141,Michael Palin,Let's see how you get on with him* eh?
4142,Michael Palin,Ah yes* he likes you. He's taken to you.
4143,Michael Palin,Blancmange.
4144,Michael Palin,I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No* you don't feed them at all.
4145,Michael Palin,They don't. They die.
4146,Michael Palin,Well of course they do* if you don't feed them.
4147,Michael Palin,You let them die* then you buy another one. It's much cheaper than feeding them and that way you have a constant variety of little companions.
4148,Michael Palin,That's the advantage of owning an ant.
4149,Michael Palin,Never mind. Here's another one.
4150,Michael Palin,Yes* sir - you'll need an ant house.
4151,Michael Palin,This is the model we recommend* sir.
4152,Michael Palin,Yes.
4153,Michael Palin,Well* none at all really. And then some pieces of cage furniture which will keep him entertained.
4154,Michael Palin,Here's an ant-wheel* ant-swing* and a very nice one here* a little ladder - he can run up there and ring the bell at the top* that's a little trick he can learn.
4155,Michael Palin,Not really* no* but it's best to have one just in case* and here's a two-way radio he can play with... and of course you'll need the book.
4156,Michael Palin,Yes* the book on ants.
4157,Michael Palin,So* sir* that is* if I may say so* one hundred and eighty-four pounds one and a half p.* sir.
4158,Michael Palin,Yes* sir* if you don't mind leaving a blood-sample* and a piece of skin off the back of the scalp just here* sir ...
4159,Michael Palin,I should* sir... much less painful. Anyway sir* you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life* eh? Well* a friend for its life anyway...
4160,Michael Palin,If the little chap should go to an early grave* sir* give us a ring and we'll stick a few in an envelope* all right?
4161,Michael Palin,Not at all* thank
4162,Michael Palin,* Mr Ellis.
4163,Michael Palin,I said thank you* Mr Ellis...
4164,Michael Palin,Oh!
4165,Michael Palin,Who?
4166,Michael Palin,Hello and welcome to the University of the Air. And first this afternoon* part seventeen in our series of lectures on animal communications. This afternoon we look at recent discoveries in the field of intraspecific signalling codes in the family formicidea.
4167,Michael Palin,We interrupt this programme to bring you the latest news of the extraordinary Michael Ellis saga. Apparently Michael Ellis...
4168,Michael Palin,... nd of the announcement. And now back to 'University of the Air'* and our series for advanced medical students* 'Elements of Surgical Homeopathic Practice'. Part 68 - 'Ants'.
4169,Michael Palin,Hello formicidophiles! Before the blood and guts that you're waiting to see* let's have a look at the anatomy of the little ant.
4170,Michael Palin,Second floor ... stationery* leather goods* tribal head injuries* cricket bats* film stars* dolphinariums.
4171,Michael Palin,Third floor ... cosmetics* books* Irish massage* tribal head-gear* ants..
4172,Michael Palin,about ants!
4173,Michael Palin,Straight on* then left* then right past the thing* then* up the little stairs* then right by where it's gone all soft* then down the wobbly bit* left past the nail* past the brown stain on the wall to your right and it's the door marked exit straight ahead of you on the left.
4174,Michael Palin,Fourth floor... kiddies' vasectomies...
4175,Michael Palin,Sorry?
4176,Michael Palin,The what?
4177,Michael Palin,Oh* the
4178,Michael Palin,Gladys* where are toupees now?
4179,Michael Palin,This gentleman wants one.
4180,Michael Palin,That's right* yes* you go left at artificial limbs and hearing aids* right at dentures and it's on your left just by glass eyes. It doesn't say toupees to avoid embarrassing people* but you can smell 'em.
4181,Michael Palin,My loyal subjects* we are here today on a matter of national import. My late husband and we are increasingly disturbed by recent developments in literary style
4182,Michael Palin,that have taken place here in Germany ... er England. There seems to be an increasing tendency for ze ent... the ent... the ant... to become the dominant ... was is der deutsches Entwicklungsbund...
4183,Michael Palin,Theme ... of modern poetry here in Germany. We are not ... amusiert?
4184,Michael Palin,Entertained. From now on* ants is verboten. Instead it's skylarks* daffodils* nightingales* light brigades and ... was ist das schreckliche Gepong ... es schmecke wie ein Scheisshaus... und so weiter. Well* we must away now or we shall be late for the races. God bless you alles.
4185,Michael Palin,Have you got one?
4186,Michael Palin,So did I.
4187,Michael Palin,That is good.
4188,Michael Palin,How did you know?
4189,Michael Palin,Is it?
4190,Michael Palin,It's better than yours.
4191,Michael Palin,Oh no* not again.
4192,Michael Palin,Yeah* look at it. Where did you get that* Mac Fisheries?
4193,Michael Palin,There's no need to be ashamed.
4194,Michael Palin,Complain about an ant?
4195,Michael Palin,All right. Take a seat.
4196,Michael Palin,Yes* madam. I'll speak to the makers personally* all right?
4197,Michael Palin,Next?
4198,Michael Palin,Yes* yes* I'll see to you in a moment* sir.
4199,Michael Palin,Do take a seat. I'm sorry it's on fire.
4200,Michael Palin,Where were you out east?
4201,Michael Palin,Extinguisher?
4202,Michael Palin,Are there many fires in Norway?
4203,Michael Palin,I am sorry to hear that.
4204,Michael Palin,No* I meant...
4205,Michael Palin,Yes* yes - well look...
4206,Michael Palin,Yes. It was quite a good show. I think that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone.
4207,Michael Palin,Taking life as it comes* sharing the good things and the bad things* finding laughter and fun wherever they go - it is with these two happy-go-lucky rogues that our story begins.
4208,Michael Palin,Len Hanky! Chiropodist* voyeur* hen-teaser. The man of whom the chairman of Fiat once said...
4209,Michael Palin,Yes! Tonight we examine the career of Gino Agnelli! The man who started from nothing to build up one of the greatest firms in Europe.
4210,Michael Palin,Bunch of monkeys on the ceiling* sir! Grab your egg and fours and let's get the bacon delivered!
4211,Michael Palin,You know...bally ten-penny ones dropping in the custard...
4212,Michael Palin,un...Charlie Choppers chucking a handful...
4213,Michael Palin,Slower
4214,Michael Palin,* sir?
4215,Michael Palin,Um...sausage squad up the blue end?
4216,Michael Palin,Um...cabbage crates coming over the briny?
4217,Michael Palin,Sir* we all know ...
4218,Michael Palin,I'm sorry?
4219,Michael Palin,Sir* we all know the facts of this case; that Sapper Walters* being in possession of expensive military equipment* to wit one Lee Enfield .303 rifle and 72 rounds of ammunition* valued at a hundred and forty pounds three shillings and sixpence* chose instead to use wet towels to take an enemy command post in the area of Basingstoke ...
4220,Michael Palin,No* no* no* sir* no.
4221,Michael Palin,The result of his action was that the enemy ...
4222,Michael Palin,Basingstoke in Westphalia* sir.
4223,Michael Palin,The result of Sapper Walters's action was that the enemy received wet patches upon their trousers and in some cases small red strawberry marks upon their thighs ...
4224,Michael Palin,It's on the map* sir.
4225,Michael Palin,The map of Westphalia as used by the army* sir.
4226,Michael Palin,It's a municipal borough sir* twenty-seven miles north-north east of Southhampton. Its chief manufactures ...
4227,Michael Palin,Yes sir ... bricks ... clothing. Nearby are remains of Basing House* burned down by Cromwell's cavalry in 1645 ...
4228,Michael Palin,Cole Porter* sir.
4229,Michael Palin,No* alas not* sir ... this was Cole Porter who wrote `Anything Goes'. Sir* I shall seek to prove that the man before this court ...
4230,Michael Palin,I
4231,Michael Palin,your pardon* sir?
4232,Michael Palin,No* this one's different* sir.
4233,Michael Palin,What* sir?
4234,Michael Palin,Sir* really* this is rather ...
4235,Michael Palin,With respect sir* I shall seek to prove that the man before you in the dock being in the possession of the following: one pair of army boots* value three pounds seven and six* one pair of serge trousers* value two pounds three and six* one pair of gaiters value sixty-eight pounds ten shillings* one ...
4236,Michael Palin,They were special gaiters* sir.
4237,Michael Palin,Yes* sir* they were made in France. One beret costing fourteen shillings* one pair of ...
4238,Michael Palin,Oh ...
4239,Michael Palin,they were made of a special fabric* sir. The buckles were made of empire silver instead of brass. The total value of the uniform was there ...
4240,Michael Palin,They were a presentation pair sir* from the regiment. The total value of the uniform ...
4241,Michael Palin,Sir* it seems to me totally irrelevant to the case whether the gaiters were presented to him or not* sir.
4242,Michael Palin,He ... used to do things for them. The total value ...
4243,Michael Palin,He .. he used to oblige them* sir. The total value ...
4244,Michael Palin,Yes* sir. The total value of the uniform ...
4245,Michael Palin,What sir?
4246,Michael Palin,He ... um ... used to make them happy in little ways* sir. The total value of the uniform could therefore not have been less than ...
4247,Michael Palin,Sir! I submit that this is totally irrelevant.
4248,Michael Palin,He used to ram things up their ...
4249,Michael Palin,Sir! We haven't finished the prosecution!
4250,Michael Palin,Yes! Coming to this cinema soon!
4251,Michael Palin,THRILL! to the excitement of a night emission over Germany.
4252,Michael Palin,When the pilot* Jennifer
4253,Michael Palin,With Ginger* as the half-man* half-woman* parrot whose unnatural instincts brought forbidden love in the aviary. And Roger as Pip* the half-parrot* half-man* half-woman* three-quarter badger* ex-bigamist negro preacher* for whom banjo-playing was very difficult* and he never mastered it although he took several courses and went to banjo college ... er ... and everything ... don't miss it!
4254,Michael Palin,Coming to your cinema soon!
4255,Michael Palin,Only five minutes from this restaurant! But now!
4256,Michael Palin,It's ...
4257,Michael Palin,Budgie?
4258,Michael Palin,I had a budgie once you know* amusing little chap* used to stick his head in a bell ... what was his name* now ... Joey? ... Xerxes? ...
4259,Michael Palin,Mr Heath* that was the name of the budgie.
4260,Michael Palin,What ... give them different names?
4261,Michael Palin,How about `Dad's Navy'?
4262,Michael Palin,`I Married Lucy.'
4263,Michael Palin,Oh* yes* a long time ago* though* they'd never remember it.
4264,Michael Palin,`I Married A Tree.'
4265,Michael Palin,`I Married Three Rabbit Jelly Moulds'!
4266,Michael Palin,You're in security* aren't you?
4267,Michael Palin,I say* mater* cabbage crates coming over the briny.
4268,Michael Palin,Er...cow-catchers creeping up on the conning towers...
4269,Michael Palin,Caribou nibbling at the croquet hoops.
4270,Michael Palin,Oh* jolly good show. Is 'Becca about?
4271,Michael Palin,What a super woody sort of phrase. `Gorn orff'.
4272,Michael Palin,Oh* what rotten luck ... oh well ... whole afternoon to kill ... better have a bath I suppose.
4273,Michael Palin,Oh* OK.
4274,Michael Palin,For ... she's going to marry Yum Yum ... oh crikey. The old song finished her orff.
4275,Michael Palin,I'm afraid Mrs Vermin Jones appears to have passed orn.
4276,Michael Palin,Fraid so.
4277,Michael Palin,Dr Natal ... out please!
4278,Michael Palin,Out please! I'm terribly sorry* sir. We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric Association* a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist. This is my Psychiatric Club tie* and as you can see the cufflinks match. I've got a copy of 'Psychiatry Today' in my bag* which I think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in which she asks how the psychiatry is going* and I think you'll realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if you'd like to ask me any questions about psychiatry* I bet I can answer them.
4279,Michael Palin,OK* you've got this girl on your bed* you've had a few drinks* you've got her stretched out and her feet on the mantelpiece ...
4280,Michael Palin,yes* what is it?
4281,Michael Palin,Oh* oh my God! Ok* thank you.
4282,Michael Palin,Is this your chair?
4283,Michael Palin,It's been stolen!
4284,Michael Palin,This belongs to a Mrs Edgeworth of Pinner - she's standing over there.
4285,Michael Palin,It's got her name on the bottom.
4286,Michael Palin,You don't believe I'm a policeman* do you?
4287,Michael Palin,What am I wearing on my head?
4288,Michael Palin,A policeman's helmet!
4289,Michael Palin,You see that?
4290,Michael Palin,That little number there?
4291,Michael Palin,That is a Metropolitan Area Identification Code. No helmet is authentic without that number.
4292,Michael Palin,Kids helmets* helmets you get in toy shops* helmets you buy at Christmas. None of them is authentic ... Hang on.
4293,Michael Palin,Hang on!
4294,Michael Palin,Mind you I didn't join the police force just to wear the helmets you know. That just happens to be one of the little perks. There are plenty of jobs where I could have worn a helmet* but not such a nice helmet.
4295,Michael Palin,This helmet* I think* beats even some of the more elaborate helmets worn by the Tsar's private army* the so-called Axi red warriors. You know about them?
4296,Michael Palin,Ah! Their helmets used to look like ... you got any paper?
4297,Michael Palin,I'll have that!
4298,Michael Palin,Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here* and three gold - and in those days it really was gold* that's part of the reason the Tsar was so unpopular - three gold bands surmounted by a golden eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet* eh?
4299,Michael Palin,I think the domed helmet wins every time over the flattened job* you know* even when they're three cornered ...
4300,Michael Palin,... you want something to eat?
4301,Michael Palin,Hang on. You can't park here you know.
4302,Michael Palin,No parked! What's that then?
4303,Michael Palin,Right. I'm taking that in for forensic examination.
4304,Michael Palin,Because it might have been used as a murder weapon* that's why!
4305,Michael Palin,Beer?
4306,Michael Palin,Now* the Chaldeans* who used to inhabit the area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers* their helmets were of the modular restrained kind of type ...
4307,Michael Palin,Oh you are* you are!
4308,Michael Palin,Of course I do.
4309,Michael Palin,Of course not.
4310,Michael Palin,What?
4311,Michael Palin,No* of course I don't mind your father coming to live with us.
4312,Michael Palin,What do you mean?
4313,Michael Palin,He wants to put his bed in our room?
4314,Michael Palin,Oh good ...
4315,Michael Palin,No. I'm not having that.
4316,Michael Palin,Well I do* but ...
4317,Michael Palin,He's bound to peek.
4318,Michael Palin,No! No! No!!
4319,Michael Palin,No* no.
4320,Michael Palin,Oh yes* all right* yes.
4321,Michael Palin,Good night.
4322,Michael Palin,It's not the Cutty Sark!
4323,Michael Palin,That was a great fight* Champ* a great fight* you hear! Oh boy* what a fight* Champ* what a great fight! You nearly had him* Champ* you nearly had him ... where's his head?
4324,Michael Palin,You were great* Champ* d'you hear* you were great!
4325,Michael Palin,Yeah* I think it was a mistake him wearing spectacles.
4326,Michael Palin,Oh well* get that sewn onto his body in time for the press pictures.
4327,Michael Palin,Wasn't he great my boy?
4328,Michael Palin,The way he kept fighting after his head came off!
4329,Michael Palin,Yeah* I reckon that if he could've lasted till the end of that first minute* he would've had the Killer worried.
4330,Michael Palin,Oh he was great. Did you see his left arm?
4331,Michael Palin,OK* we'll look around the hall after everybody's gone.
4332,Michael Palin,And where did the head land? Right at the back* that's justice...
4333,Michael Palin,What d'you want?
4334,Michael Palin,No* no* we've got his head. He ain't hurt that bad.
4335,Michael Palin,OK* give it to me. I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow. I'll give it to him.
4336,Michael Palin,How's the Champ?
4337,Michael Palin,OK* well keep the dressing gown kinda loose* OK.
4338,Michael Palin,OK boys* come on in!
4339,Michael Palin,This boy has never let me down. He's the pluckiest goddamn fighter I've ever trained.
4340,Michael Palin,No* no* we were expecting that. I told them to expect it to and it did. He ain't stupid.
4341,Michael Palin,Yeah OK. But keep the questions simple.
4342,Michael Palin,I said keep the questions simple!
4343,Michael Palin,There's no question of burying the kid. He's just reaching the top.
4344,Michael Palin,No* he ain't going to no hospital. He's got the return fight next week.
4345,Michael Palin,And there's Frank Sinatra leaving the ring. Behind him is George Raft* another great boxing fan* Martin Bormann* acknowledging the applause* and with him of course is Gus Himmler* who did an awful lot for the sport in his country in the early 1940s. And here comes the Champ now and he seems in good shape to meet the Killer once again. Before an audience* some of them will have paid $920*000 million for the privilege of seeing this boy get beaten up. And there's the bell.
4346,Michael Palin,And a left and a right and a right jab that's taken the Champ's shoulder off. And here's the Killer again with a right and another left and a bash with a hammer and a terrific smack with a heavy thud right into the skull and there's a gaping hole right through the Champ's body now. And now the Killer's working on the cut eye with a series of beautifully placed punches and the head's coming loose.
4347,Michael Palin,Morning Mrs Non-Gorilla.
4348,Michael Palin,No ... been shopping.
4349,Michael Palin,A piston engine!
4350,Michael Palin,Oooh! It was a bargain.
4351,Michael Palin,Hello* and welcome to 'A Room in Polonius's House'. Well tonight is European Cup night. One result is already in from Munich. The European Cup* first round* second leg* Bayern München 4397* Wrexham 1. So Wrexham going through there on aggregate. Well* now it's time for racing* so let's go straight over to Epsom and Brian McNutty.
4352,Michael Palin,Well here in High Street Epsom* There are ample opportunities for all kinds of redevelopment. As you can see*
4353,Michael Palin,behind me now there are a high level of low density consumer units* still not fully maximizing site value. This could be radically improved by a carefully planned programme of demolition. And of course most of the occupants ere...er...elderly folks* so they wouldn't put up much of a fight.
4354,Michael Palin,Good afternoon* Brian.
4355,Michael Palin,Well* a fine horse* Brian. You know you can't go wrong.
4356,Michael Palin,Oh very definitely* very definitely* indeed* certainly Brian.
4357,Michael Palin,No* no I think you're wrong there* Des* with the right kind of going* he's going to be in there at the finish* Des.
4358,Michael Palin,Well a very exciting race there at Epsom. And now over to the European Cup at Barcelona where the latest news is that Miguel Otana* the burly Real Madrid striker* was sent off for breaking wind in the forty-third minute. He'd already been cautioned for pursing his lips earlier on in the game and now he's off! So let's see a playback of that ... Brian.
4359,Michael Palin,Jimmy?
4360,Michael Palin,What do you make of that?
4361,Michael Palin,Hamlet?
4362,Michael Palin,Well you've got the girl on the bed and her legs up on the mantelpiece ...
4363,Michael Palin,And then...
4364,Michael Palin,We are here today to witness the opening of a new
4365,Michael Palin,Wir kommen hier heute Morgen für die Einfang auf dem neue Kabinett für die Poste.
4366,Michael Palin,A perfectly ordinary morning in a perfectly ordinary English suburb. Life goes on as it has done for years.
4367,Michael Palin,But soon this quiet pattern of life was to change irrevocably. The commonplace routine of a typical Monday morning would never be the same again* for into this quiet little community came ... Mr Neutron!
4368,Michael Palin,Mr Neutron! The most dangerous and terrifying man in the world! The man with the strength of an army! The wisdom of all the scholars in history! The man who had the power to destroy the world.
4369,Michael Palin,Mr Neutron. No one knows what strange and distant planet he came from* or where he was going to!... Wherever he went* terror and destruction were sure to follow.
4370,Michael Palin,Mr Neutron! The man whose incredible power has made him the most feared man of all time... waits for his moment to destroy this little world utterly!
4371,Michael Palin,Then there's Stanley ... he's our eldest ... he's a biochemist in Sutton. He's married to Shirley...
4372,Michael Palin,Yes* that's right* I think she's a lovely person.
4373,Michael Palin,My husband doesn't ... he thinks she's a bit flash.
4374,Michael Palin,And they* of course* they come down most weekends* so you'll be able to meet them then.
4375,Michael Palin,And very important* too. If you don't care for your scalp* you get rabies. Then there's Kenneth* he's our youngest. Mind you* he's a bit of a problem... at least my husband thinks he is* anyway.
4376,Michael Palin,Mind you* the one we hear so much about nowadays is Karen. She married a Canadian - he's a dentist - they live in Alberta - two lovely children* Gary who's three* Leslie who's six. They look like the spitting image of Karen. D'you want to see a photo ... ?
4377,Michael Palin,All right.
4378,Michael Palin,Meanwhile in Washington* at the headquarters of 'FEAR' - the Federal Egg Answering Room - in reality a front name for 'FEEBLE' - the Free World Extra-Earthly Bodies Location and Extermination Centre... all was not well.
4379,Michael Palin,Hello?
4380,Michael Palin,You mean FEEBLE?
4381,Michael Palin,What is it?
4382,Michael Palin,Mr Neutron! Oh my God! OK - Surround the entire city! Send in four waves of armed paratroopers with full ground-to-air missile support! Alert all air bases! Destroy all roads! We'll bomb the town flat if we have to!
4383,Michael Palin,OK! Hold everything! Hold everything! Hold it! Lay off! Lay off... Where is he?
4384,Michael Palin,All right! I want a full-scale Red Alert throughout the world! Surround everyone with everything we've got! Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon we can lay our hands on! I want... I want three full-scale global nuclear alerts with every army* navy and air force unit on eternal standby!
4385,Michael Palin,And introduce conscription!
4386,Michael Palin,Right!
4387,Michael Palin,So the world was in the grip of FEAR! A huge and terrifying crisis generated by one man!
4388,Michael Palin,... easily the most dangerous man the world has ever seen* honestly. Though still biding his time* he could strike at any moment. Could he be stopped in time?
4389,Michael Palin,Yes?
4390,Michael Palin,Have we bombed anywhere? Have we shown 'em we got
4391,Michael Palin,?
4392,Michael Palin,Good. Good. We don't want anyone to think we're chicken.
4393,Michael Palin,Of us?
4394,Michael Palin,Of our power?
4395,Michael Palin,Wow! I bet they are. I bet they are. I bet they're really scared.
4396,Michael Palin,Do we have any figures on how scared they are?
4397,Michael Palin,Ah! But it's not working?
4398,Michael Palin,OK. We'll try another tactic. We'll try and out-smart this Neutron guy. Yes* there's one man who could nail him.
4399,Michael Palin,He's the most brilliant man I ever met. We were in the CIA together. He's retired now. He breeds rabbits up in the Yukon... '
4400,Michael Palin,His name is Teddy Salad.
4401,Michael Palin,Lettuces* cucumber* radishes. Yeah* yeah* yeah.
4402,Michael Palin,The Yukon. Oh* and Carpenter ...
4403,Michael Palin,Make sure you get a decent disguise.
4404,Michael Palin,While precious time was being lost in Canada* the seconds were ticking away for the free world...
4405,Michael Palin,Already Neutron - who* you will remember* is infinitely the most dangerous man in the world* he
4406,Michael Palin,is - was gathering allies together.
4407,Michael Palin,Oh* I've tried that ... I once got down to fifty-six stone. But I couldn't stay like that. I used to take potatoes wherever I went. I used to go to the cinema with three hundredweight of King Edwards* I'd eat 'em all before I got out of the toilet. I had to go on to bread.
4408,Michael Palin,Teddy Salad?
4409,Michael Palin,You don't like it?
4410,Michael Palin,You're the first person to order a salad for two years. All the Eskimos eat here is fish* fish ...
4411,Michael Palin,What fish you want today* uh?
4412,Michael Palin,Bream! Where do I get a bream this time of year? You bloody choosy Eskimo pests.
4413,Michael Palin,Why don't you like a nice plate of canelloni?
4414,Michael Palin,I've had my lot of the Arctic Circle. I wish I was back in Oldham ...
4415,Michael Palin,Haddock!
4416,Michael Palin,Here's your bloody fish.
4417,Michael Palin,I'm not an Eskimo!
4418,Michael Palin,While Carpenter took the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had for walkies* events in the world's capitals were moving fast!
4419,Michael Palin,Prime Minister.
4420,Michael Palin,Prime Minister* we've just had the Supreme Commander US Forces on the phone. Apparently they want a full-scale Red Alert!
4421,Michael Palin,They want a full-scale Red Alert - every troop movement...
4422,Michael Palin,Well apparently the whole structure of world peace may be threatened unless we immediately...
4423,Michael Palin,Well anyway* this Mr Neutron* is located somewhere in the London area. We must find and exterminate him. The Americans say if we don't* they will.
4424,Michael Palin,The Americans say if we won't
4425,Michael Palin,will!
4426,Michael Palin,They'll bomb the entire London area.
4427,Michael Palin,They won't bomb
4428,Michael Palin,.
4429,Michael Palin,Sure.
4430,Michael Palin,Well apparently they haven't got Neutron yet... but when they do...
4431,Michael Palin,Carpenter ... er ... ugh ... ah...Carpenter...
4432,Michael Palin,Yes... yes... it's just it's so goddam painful in here... what's the problem?
4433,Michael Palin,I ... oh God ... I ... I ... I...
4434,Michael Palin,I gotta go walkies again.
4435,Michael Palin,OK. We'll bomb Neutron out. Get me Moscow! Peking! and Shanklin* Isle of Wight!
4436,Michael Palin,And so the Great Powers and the people of Shanklin* Isle of Wight* drew their net in ever-tightening circles around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced. They bombed Cairo* Bangkok* Cape Town* Buenos Aires* Harrow* Hammersmith* Stepney* Wandsworth and Enfield... But always it was the wrong place.
4437,Michael Palin,But what of Mr Neutron* the most fearfully dangerous man in the world! The man who could destroy entire galaxies with his wrist* the man who could tear fruit machines apart with his eyeballs... He had not been idle!
4438,Michael Palin,In fact he had fallen in love... with the lady who 'does' for Mrs Entrail...
4439,Michael Palin,Another time when I was in Cairo* I was disguised as a water hydrant. The whole top part of my head had been removed and...
4440,Michael Palin,And I functioned! D'you hear? I really worked. I could put out a fire.
4441,Michael Palin,Mind you* it hurt a bit...
4442,Michael Palin,OK. Give me another meatball and I'll tell you.
4443,Michael Palin,OK listen carefully... I won't repeat this. You understand?
4444,Michael Palin,I know where Neutron is right now. I know the exact address and the exact house and the exact road...
4445,Michael Palin,He's not in America...
4446,Michael Palin,He's not in... Asia!
4447,Michael Palin,He's not in..* Australia!
4448,Michael Palin,He's in... Europe!
4449,Michael Palin,And you wanna know where in Europe?
4450,Michael Palin,OK. OK* I'll tell you. He's in England... In London... at Number 19...
4451,Michael Palin,OK. That's the Yukon - what's left?
4452,Michael Palin,OK! Let's start with my office.
4453,Michael Palin,Ankwat i odr inkerat Gobi Desert Ulverston Road...
4454,Michael Palin,Ik artwar* hyaddin...
4455,Michael Palin,Has Mr Neutron escaped in time? Is the world utterly destroyed? How can Mr Neutron and his child bride survive? Will his mighty powers be of any avail against the holocaust? Stay tuned to this channel.
4456,Michael Palin,Good evening* last week we learned how to saw a lady in half. This week we're going to learn how to saw a lady into three bits and dispose of the body...
4457,Michael Palin,There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Liberal Party...
4458,Michael Palin,Sorry* mum.
4459,Michael Palin,Now if we ...
4460,Michael Palin,Oh* sorry* mum ... Now if we lived in Rhodesia there'd be someone to mop that up for you.
4461,Michael Palin,Dad... ?
4462,Michael Palin,No no* my dad...
4463,Michael Palin,Dad? Why is Rhodesia called Rhodesia?...
4464,Michael Palin,Oh sorry* dad.
4465,Michael Palin,I was just washing up...
4466,Michael Palin,Mum? Do you know why Rhodesia's called Rhodesia?
4467,Michael Palin,Oh* sorry* mum.
4468,Michael Palin,Yea* mum.
4469,Michael Palin,A very good try there* by the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire. Professor...
4470,Michael Palin,Lady Organs?
4471,Michael Palin,Well* harsh words there for the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire* at present holders of the East Midlands Most Awful Family Award - Lower Middle-Class Section but unable today to score more than fifteen on our disgustometer. Well with the scores all in from the judges* the Garibaldis are number three ... and a surprise number two ... the Fanshaw-Chumleighs of Berkshire...
4472,Michael Palin,Absolutely super. Pat and Max are coming down from Eton to help daddy count money.
4473,Michael Palin,Well* some of the wonderful behaviour that made the Fanshaw-Chumleighs the second Most Awful Family in Britain 1974. But the winners* by a clear ten point margin* are once again the awful Jodrell family of Durham. Unfortunately* we're not allowed to show you some of the performance that won them an award* but I assure you it was of the very highest standard* was it not* Lady Organs?
4474,Michael Palin,Yes* yes...
4475,Michael Palin,Well* thank you very much* Lady Organs ... and from all of us all* well done to the Jodrells ... and to all of you* not forgetting those of you who may be halfway in between* without whom* of course* and not forgetting who made it all possible* when* and we'll be back* until then and so it's goodnight from me and here's wishing you a safe journey home* thank you for watching this show* don't forget it was all great fun* I've enjoyed it* and I hope you watching at home have enjoyed it too.
4476,Michael Palin,And when he had built up Cedron* he sent Horsemen there* and an host of footmen to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea* as the King commanded them...
4477,Michael Palin,Oh yes indeed ... as the book of Maccabee said ... Ye as the flea is like unto an oxen* so is the privet hedge liken unto a botanist black in thy sight* O Lord!
4478,Michael Palin,Yea ... as Raymond Chandler said* it was one of those days when Los Angeles felt like a rock-hard fig.
4479,Michael Palin,Oh... ye... as Dirk Bogarde said in his autobiography...
4480,Michael Palin,Well to be quite frank* Brigadier ... one can't walk so closely with a chap like you for... for so long without... feeling something deep down inside* even if it isn't anything... anything ... very much.
4481,Michael Palin,Not on television ... no...
4482,Michael Palin,Ah yes... but not with this sort of thing...
4483,Michael Palin,Yes...
4484,Michael Palin,There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Liberal Par...
4485,Michael Palin,This is Stonehenge ... and it's from here we go to Africa.
4486,Michael Palin,Oh* super ... well* I've just been told that this is not in fact the legendary walking tree of Dahomey* this is one of Africa's many stationary trees* Arborus Barnbet Gaseoignus. In fact we've just missed the walking tree... it left here at eight o'clock this morning... was heading off in that direction... so we'll see if we can go and catch it up. Come on boys.
4487,Michael Palin,Well* we're still keeping up with it* but it's setting a furious pace. Early this morning we thought we'd spotted it* but it turned out to be an Angolan sauntering tree* Amazellus Robin Ray* out walking with a Gambian Sidling Bush...
4488,Michael Palin,But* what Rupert had in fact discovered was something very different...
4489,Michael Palin,The Turkish Little Rude Plant.
4490,Michael Palin,No* what they had come across was a tribe lost to man since time immemorial... the legendary Batsmen of the Kalahari...
4491,Michael Palin,Warwickshire had dismissed the Kalahari Batsmen for 140* and then it was their turn to face this extraordinary Kalahari attack. Pratt was the first to go* but Pratt and Pratt put on a second wicket stand of nought* which was broken by Odinga in his most hostile mood.
4492,Michael Palin,Thats B. Pratt* hit wicket - 0. But Pratt and Z. Pratt dug in and took the score to a half...
4493,Michael Palin,Typical of Umbonga's hostile opening spell was his dismissal of V.E. Pratt* who offered no resistance to this delivery...
4494,Michael Palin,... and he was caught behind.
4495,Michael Palin,But by lunch the situation had changed dramatically.
4496,Michael Palin,And so with the tension colossal as we come up to the last ball ... that's all from us.
4497,Michael Palin,Hello and welcome to Paignton* because it's from Paignton that we take you straight back to the studio.
4498,Michael Palin,Well we're already here so let's go over there.
